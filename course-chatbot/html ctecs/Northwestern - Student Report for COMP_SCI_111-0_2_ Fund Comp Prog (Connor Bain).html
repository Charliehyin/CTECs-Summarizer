Bain makes the quizzes very simple (same format each time), so try to understand how he writes questions for the quizzes. He is very helpful when you ask questions in class or outside. There are many helpful TAs and PMs to get help from. Try not to use Chat, as the code should be simple enough to grasp without it.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_14c6b8ee-2253-4929-9831-930b636700bc">As someone with no programming experience, this class was interesting...basic structure is as follows: on Mondays, there&#x27;s a lecture previewing the topic of the week and the homework is posted; Wednesdays, you&#x27;re assigned practice problems related to said topic that you&#x27;re supposed to work with your group on (you can do it by yourself outside of class, but then it&#x27;s for accuracy); on Fridays, it&#x27;s review and required practice (attendance taken). 94 is an A for some reason but there are helpful policies in place (drop lowest quiz grade, lowest exercise grade, etc.) that make it an easy A&ndash; at least.<br/><br/>Homework: The difficultly spike after the first exercise is real, and expect to spend upwards of 6 hours per assignment. Start as early as possible on Mondays and try to finish by Wednesday at the latest. After that, it&#x27;s difficult to get help as office hours become packed. Aside from that, it&#x27;s not hard to get a good grade on these, but they&#x27;re very challenging at times.<br/><br/>Peer mentors: A useful system some of the time, but a headache at others. Very likely you&#x27;ll have to visit office hours at least once per exercise. I recommend going to a couple of different people&#x27;s office hours towards the begin of the quarter to figure out who you like the most. Some PMs are great and actually want to help you find the answer. Others are condescending, do everything in their power to avoid giving you a hint towards the answer, or simply don&#x27;t even show up on time (or at all) to their published office hours. Find good times and mentors and stick with them. <br/><br/>Quizzes: The exams in this class are 4 &quot;quizzes&quot;: one final, while the other 3 cover topics from that portion of the class. 1st is easy, 2nd is very difficult, and 3rd is somewhere in&ndash;between. Biggest problem with these is that they have no resemblance whatsoever with the lectures, exercises, tutorials, or literal practice quizzes that they give you to study with. Functions are 10x longer or more complex than anything you discuss in class, and you only have about 3 min&#x2F;question to figure out the answer. This makes studying very difficult, but at least you get to drop one. <br/><br/>Language: Yes, Racket is annoying, but people overstate that. However, it does mean the internet can&#x27;t help you any with problems. It does a good job at teaching the fundamentals of programming, and if you&#x27;ve never programmed before, you might even have a leg up (no other language to confuse it with).</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_14c6b8ee-2253-4929-9831-930b636700bc">This course is honestly a really good and easy first cs course to take at Northwestern, but kind of annoying if you have some programming understanding. Racket (the platform used) is quite different than traditional programming, and therefore can be slightly irritating to use when figuring out the syntax. The weekly programs you have to submit are honestly really simple and never take more than at max two hours. The course overall is super fair, and Prof. Bain is a really nice and engaging lecturer. This quizzes are also really fair and simple, and it&#x27;s nice not having additional midterms&#x2F;finals throughout the class.</td>

Definitely take this class with him if you can since he is very passionate about teaching it and does so in a good way. As far as the programming language goes (Racket), it seems very confusing at first for all prior experience levels but you slowly start to get it. It&#x27;s definitely the programming fundamentals you take away rather than the language itself.  This course teaches about functional, imperative, and object&ndash;oriented programming in a much different structure and progression than other CS classes you may have taken in the past. The grade policies for the course are super helpful and really cover any special circumstances throughout the quarter. Just go to class and tutorials and you will do great.</td>

This course is advertised as a course that is great for students with no coding experience at all, but it was more difficult than I expected given the above statement. I also understand that Racket is used to establish more of the concepts than learning a specific language, but I don&#x27;t see why using Python, for example, would be significantly worse. Sometimes Racket was frustrating to work with, and less intuitive. The exercises and quizzes were sometimes challenging, but I don&#x27;t think getting an A is a big struggle with the drop policy (lowest quiz, lowest exercise, etc dropped). Some lectures seemed too slow and some seemed to fast but overall they were okay. I like that the lecture recordings are posted online.

I also think if you&#x27;re not in McCormick&#x2F;it&#x27;s not a requirement, it might be better to avoid this class if you haven&#x27;t coded before because I&#x27;ve heard Racket is just kind of a weird language to start with, and it&#x27;s not particularly useful. <br/><br/>I will say, it isn&#x27;t necessarily hard to do well in the class.

It was amazing, and such a great start to my time at Northwestern. As someone with very limited coding experience, I was very nervous to take this class, but I had nothing to worry about. The class is taught in Racket, which is a coding language that no one knows, in order to even the playing field and force everyone to get &#x27;back to basics.&#x27; The idea behind the course is that it&#x27;s meant to teach you how to learn to code. I haven&#x27;t started learning other languages yet, so I can&#x27;t attest to its effectiveness in that sense, but I felt that I learned a lot in this class. Professor Bain was an incredible professor, who very clearly cares a lot about the success of his students, and is very knowledgeable about the subject matter. I was able to go up to him and ask questions about assignments whenever I needed some clarification, and he always answered questions in a way that allowed me to reach the final answer myself, without him just giving me code that would work. Some people think Bain&#x27;s corny jokes are lame, but I think those people are just no fun. Bain makes a real effort to make coding relevant and interesting, and he is a very engaging lecturer.<br/>There were four quizzes throughout the quarter, with the last one serving as the final exam. Although we haven&#x27;t had the final yet, the first three quizzes were very similar to what we had worked on in class, and I felt overprepared for them just from going to classes, doing the work, and completing the two practice quizzes.<br/>Overall, this class was fantastic, and I can&#x27;t recommend it enough. This class is the reason I decided to major in CS, and it brought me so much joy. You will absolutely succeed in this class if you complete the assignments and ask clarifying questions when you need help :) Best of luck!</td>

As long as you put in a little bit of effort and don&#x27;t think that you know everything because you have already done programming, you will be fine. Racket is an annoying language to use but it becomes pretty intuitive after a while. Grading is super lenient and getting to drop one of the four quizzes is really helpful. Bain is super helpful and his teaching style is really easy to follow.</td>

I&#x27;m sure everyone will tell you about this but CS 111 is taught using a funky language called DrRacket which definitely would NOT be my pick for an intro CS class. I sincerely feel bad for everyone whose first programming language is this. I did somewhat learn to appreciate the syntax and functionality of it by the end of the class, though. The class is intended to go over basic programming concepts which it does decently at.<br/><br/>Connor Bain himself is a hella cool and chill guy and I enjoy his silly sense of humor. I will say if you have some previous programming experience the lectures can get kind of tedious, but it makes sense since a good number of people are learning from scratch.<br/><br/>The workload isn&#x27;t too bad, you have to watch like 15&ndash;45 minutes worth of lectures before class on Wednesday and there&#x27;s a weekly coding assignment which takes up to a few hours to do. There are four quizzes throughout the quarter which are sort of midterms (but really the vibe is more of like a unit test in high school). The absolute best part of this class is that you can drop your lowest quiz score, which means if you do well on the first three quizzes you can literally just not go to the final quiz.</td>

At the least, this class will certainly help you determine whether or not taking more CS classes is right for you, as there were many people I knew who struggled with Racket. Unless you already have a particular interest in CS and&#x2F;or have to take this class as a major requirement, it would probably be best to just take CS 110. But if you do enjoy programming and&#x2F;or find it interesting, this class is a very good introduction and Bain is a great professor.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_14c6b8ee-2253-4929-9831-930b636700bc">Overall, the course does well in teaching basic principles of computer programming. However, the quizzes (worth 45% of the whole grade) test you not on how well you can think programmatically, but rather on how much you know the language Racket, which is obsolete anyways. Some question types include understanding snippets of code, but instead of asking you what the code does, it asks for the output type in a type&ndash;flexible language. Sometimes they throw in a question where an extra parenthesis is added and you&#x27;re expected to catch syntax errors, which is not a useful skill when compilers exist. So beware of the quizzes, and I&#x27;m hoping the format gets changed soon because it seems the quizzes have been this way for years... it&#x27;s quite outdated and it&#x27;s time for a reformat.</td>

LOC 309-0,LOC,309-0,Team Dynamics,1,"In this course, we will explore team dynamics, those forces that influence a team's behavior and performance, and what can enhance or hinder potential for impact. We will analyze the contributors to team functioning and their interrelationships at multiple levels: intrapersonal, interpersonal, group and organizational. Key topics include team development, team make-up and roles, leadership and followership, decision-making, navigating conflict, collaboration and competition, effective communication, content vs. process, diversity and in-group/out-group tensions. Throughout the class, students will be analyzing and applying concepts through case studies and simulations. Assignments to demonstrate mastery include regular written individual papers and a team project.

LOC 312-0,LOC,312-0,Modern Organization and Innovations,1,"Advances in technologies, from computation to analytics to new models of management and organizations, has radically transformed both every day work and classic models of management and organization. This course takes a novel approach to understanding these transformations by partnering a SESP faculty member with industry leaders and change agents to identify and analyze changing organizational forms and the implications for work in the contemporary economy. In doing so, this course will expose students to variants in organizational models, for example, from the highly institutionalized, yet ever changing, digital firm to firm-market hybrids that supply branded service yet do not employ the providers or own the assets that provide services. Students will have weekly analytic assignments that prepare for and reflect on industry co-instructor sessions as well as a final team project. This course is suitable for undergraduate students in LOC, social policy, and related majors throughout northwestern that are interested in leadership or organizational change. This advanced, highly interactive course fulfills new Learning and Organizational Change (LOC) requirements and is open to LOC students and beyond."
LOC 313-0,LOC,313-0,Learning and Thinking in Organizations,1,"Learning & Thinking in Organizations explores human judgment and decision making under conditions of uncertainty. You will learn to recognize recurring patterns in your own cognition and that of the people around you, and examine the ways those tendencies can lead people to better or worse courses of action. The class opens with a focus on the work of two research psychologists, Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, who developed an important framework for understanding how people reach conclusions and make decisions. Their work formed the foundation of the field of behavioral economics. As we move through the quarter, we will draw on this framework to analyze human judgment and organizational decisionmaking in the domains of medicine, public health, criminal justice, and sports. We will investigate ways to use insights from research to improve the functioning of organizations, with a goal of making life better for the people that work in them and the people they serve. In the final project, working either independently or in a group, you will research an organizational phenomenon and develop a design for change using the theoretical perspectives from the course. Grading is based on quizzes, a midterm, and a final project."

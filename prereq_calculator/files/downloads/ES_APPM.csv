ES_APPM 245-0,ES_APPM,245-0,Elementary Applied Linear Algebra,1,"Basic linear algebra methods including basic matrix/vector operations, solution of linear systems of equations, eigenvalues, and singular values. Focus will be on applications of the methods on a range of engineering topics including: least squares and data fitting, game theory, graph theory, principal component analysis, linear programming, and other related engineering topics."
ES_APPM 252-1,ES_APPM,252-1,Honors Calculus for Engineers,1,"Calculus sequence for the mathematically interested students who want to dig deeper, cover more mathematical material, and see more applications than the standard calculus sequence offers. It also provides an introduction to computation (no previous experience required). Satisfies the same requirements as Math 228-1,2."

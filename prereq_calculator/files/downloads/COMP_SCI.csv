NetLogo comes with many extensions that support a variety of additional features. Students can use these extensions to create specialized models, such as complex networks, real-time data extraction, data mining, connections to physical devices, etc.. Students will also have an opportunity to explore existing and create their own participatory simulations using the HubNet architecture as well as exploring connecting real world sensors and motors to models. Students can also explore multi-level agent-based modeling in which hundreds or thousands of models are connected with NetLogo’s LevelSpace extension.

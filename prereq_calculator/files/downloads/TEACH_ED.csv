TEACH_ED 302-0,TEACH_ED,302-0,"Social, Cultural, and Linguistic Contexts of Education",1,"This course is designed to explore how the ways that we live culturally provide strengths for teaching, learning and design. The course draws from the interdisciplinary study of socio-cultural, linguistic, and contextual influences of education, as well as perspectives from learning, teaching, research and policy. Candidates will examine how issues of power and privilege as they pertain to race, ethnicity, language, class, gender, sexuality and identity politics shape and are shaped within our education system. Candidates will be asked to consider their own schooling experiences, and deeply evaluate their beliefs, thoughts and assumptions about the influence of various legal, historical, socio-cultural and linguistic factors on their ideas about teaching, learning, and schooling. Special attention will be given to the major trends that influence contemporary landscapes of PK-12 education and the potential systemic benefits and harms associated with them. Candidates will produce an autoethnography that considers the impact of personal formal and informal learning experiences rooted in racial, cultural and linguistic identity on their life view, as well as how they move through the world as advocates for justice."
TEACH_ED 309-0,TEACH_ED,309-0,Designing and Supporting Discourse-Rich Environments for Learning,1,"Across the K-12 curriculum, approaches to teaching and learning that focus on student sensemaking and meaningful learning rely on creating a classroom where much of this sensemaking work occurs through talk. Supporting productive classroom discourse is a key element in engaging students in meaningful knowledge-building work. Teachers need tools and strategies to create and support an environment in which students feel welcome and responsible for contributing by sharing their ideas, building on one another’s thinking, and working together to further their learning as a community. This course address how to support discourse in the classroom, including designing discussion-based tasks, supporting students in academic discourse, creating a classroom climate supportive of discussion, questioning strategies and talk moves that facilitate discussion, and assessment in discussion-based tasks. We will examine current approaches to supporting effective classroom discussions drawn from elementary, middle school, and high school classrooms, and across multiple disciplines including math, literacy, history, science, and others. Work in the course will involve discussing articles sharing discourse strategies and analyzing video of classroom interactions to see these approaches in action. Students will have the opportunity to work with the tools and strategies of the course in analyzing a classroom discussion they choose to observe, designing discussion-based lessons for their own teaching context, and to try out these tools in facilitating discussions with their peers."

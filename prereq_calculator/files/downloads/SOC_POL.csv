SOC_POL 313-0,SOC_POL,313-0,"Race, Inequality, and the Political Analysis of Public Policy",1,"The purpose of this course is to make you a better political analyst. This course will familiarize you with substantive research on politics that has concrete insights for reformers, political advocates, and other public policy stakeholders. The class will cover substantive issues in politics along with how they intersect with class, race, gender and partisanship. While the main focus of the course is to discuss critical issues, there will also be an emphasis on public policy and political science writing formats, styles and standards. It cannot be emphasized enough how important research, analytic and writing skills are to virtually all careers; nothing is more quickly discrediting of good ideas than bad writing. The first half of class is mainly lecture and discussion. The second half of class has been designed to promote your learning as a writer and thinker in public policy. It will provide students with a designated forum for developing and “work shopping” their written work and discussing issues covered in class. The TA will offer feedback on questions as students write, edit, and revise their papers. We will also frequently practice skills in responding critically to colleagues’ texts. One or more quizzes may be administered as well."

SOC_POL 333-0,SOC_POL,333-0,"Economics of Health, Human Capital, and Happiness",1,"Understanding causal relationships is a central goal in social science and science in general. It is not sufficient to observe what is happening, we need to know why it is happening. In this course students will learn the toolbox of causal inference econometrics with applications to the economics of health, human capital, and subjective wellbeing. The empirical methods we will cover include multivariate regressions, panel data, difference-indifference designs, instrumental variables, randomized control trials, and regression discontinuities. Health, human capital, and subjective wellbeing (“happiness”) are core dimensions of social welfare and inequality in our society. To develop effective social policies, however, it is crucial to understand the causal mechanisms driving these factors. 
Prerequisites: ECON 202-0 (Intro to Microeconomics) or equivalent and a 200-level statistics class (SESP 210-0, STAT 202-0, STAT 210-0 and PSYCH 201-0 are all suitable)."

MECH_ENG 224-0,MECH_ENG,224-0,Scientific and Embedded Programming in Python,1,"Python is arguably now the world's foremost programming language. It is the go-to coding language for data scientists, machine learning researchers, design engineers, and anyone who needs to grab and process the vast amounts of data online, from networked sensors, or smart devices. Recently Python has become practical for coding in embedded systems, as well. Embedded microcontrollers are relevant for our annual robot design competition, NU engineering teams (Solar car, Baja), internships, and experimental apparatuses. Our approach to coding emphasizes algorithm creation, debugging, methodical creation and partitioning in a modern notebook framework, as well as hardware-level access for microcontroller applications. The course is taught in an active learning format.

You don't really learn a lot unless you're completely unfamiliar with CS, and as a senior CS major taking this course it was all very redundant. Not sure why it's still a requirement for the major if it's not a prereq for any class.... A lot of seniors just have to take it. Bright side, its an easy A.</td>

It helped me to learn that I am interested in learning more about systems, and so I plan on taking a higher level systems class this spring. The class doesn't require too much work for each week, and you can have fun with the essays, so that you learn something new and interesting each week. This class may have a lot of negative reviews, but honestly it's not a bad class. I would take this class to offset some difficult classes in a quarter. Of course, as a CS major you can replace this class with a 300 level, but if you're interested about grad school and CS, then I think this class can provide a good overview, and even give you a chance to introduce yourself to professors you might want to do research with.</td>

There is an essay due every single week, along with two projects that are also essays. Basically, the class is a lot of busywork. It is not really what you would expect a computer science course to be: there is no coding at all and barely any technical content. I would only take this course if you are a CS major and it is required. Furthermore, the grading is extremely unintuitive on the essays. Some of your grade is based on how accurate your peer reviews are in comparison to a TA's.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_657dbed5-b606-475f-abb9-08f972ca370f">I found this to be an absolutely terrible course. For starters, the grading system was beyond messed up and created anxiety amongst students off the bat. I truly did not understand the rational for offering peer grading: at one point, one of the professors said that they used peer grading to avoid the TAs being inundated with grading, but that's how every other class on campus works! Reducing (necessary) work for TAs is no excuse for messing up our grades. Also, the peer grading system was totally unclear, and often students did not take it seriously. <br><br>In terms of content, I found the class very hard to follow because we had a different instructor every week. Also, the content tended to be quite boring.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_657dbed5-b606-475f-abb9-08f972ca370f">Worst part of the class: Disorganization exacerbated by the seemingly "I don't care at all" attitude of Professor Birnbaum. I am sure that others have detailed his lack of communication and inconsistencies throughout the class materials. In my opinion, this is unacceptable, even for a 101 class. It's not fair to all the people who signed up for the class and expect a basic level of clarity in terms of learning expectations and goals. <br><br>It felt extremely disappointing when I realized that I was expected to submit every single essay to be graded at a high standard and absolutely not a minute late (or 0 credit), when the class staff were constantly late with everything, literally canceling a project at the last minute or constantly asking us to submit peer reviews the evening before they were due the next morning. When I started working on my final project, I had literally not received staff feedback on any of the 8 essays I had submitted throughout the quarter. <br><br>The professor refused to do basic things like sending out emails and updating the Canvas page, and had a snarky attitude when students expressed frustration on Piazza. So much work therefore fell to the TAs. It was clear that this class was not the priority of the TAs, which is fair. However, they put in a good effort and improved throughout the quarter. <br><br>While the disorganization and lack of effort from the professor was absolutely terrible, this class can be worthwhile if take it upon yourself to make it so. The guest lecturers deliver interesting ideas in their respective areas of expertise. Some were very good. I learned a bit about many disparate areas of computer science in lectures and skimming the weekly readings.</td>

Expectations/guidelines aren't always made clear. The class is "led" by Larry Birnbaum but a lot of the actual work is done by two head TAs. Due to this understaffing, grades can often be delayed and some announcements occur with little notice.</td>

The class is currently being restructured and might change but we had to write a single–spaced paper every week over what we learned and sometimes if you don't have a background in CS then it can be difficult to back up what you are saying. We also peer–reviewed other people's essays (on average four a week) for a grade. We had two big essays this year. I recommend this class if you have at least a little bit of background and have time to write the essays (which does become easier) because it does have a curve in the end so you will not receive a bad grade.</td>

Occasionally the lecturers had interesting things to say, but coming from a background of no computer science experience, I was frequently lost and often confused about the content. It was mainly an inability to understand the technical details of the information I was being taught by guest lecturers.

We were told to write essays on topics that were introduced during lectures, but there were little to no guidelines on writing those essays, we didn't receive feedback on them so we didn't know how to improve our work, instructions on peer–grading weren't clear, and TAs were giving different instructions... When I approached Prof. Birnbaum about these issues his only advice was for me to relax.

The idea behind why it was introduced as a CS major requirement in the first place seems reasonable: it invites a number of professors who are experts in their fields to speak about a variety of important topics in computer science. This is intended to give students a general introduction to CS and get them excited about the subject, although sadly, the opposite probably occurred. The execution and management of the class was extremely poor. The entire class is based around writing short weekly essays about different CS topics with a couple longer essays sprinkled in between. Conceptually, this isn't a terrible idea and is rather common among introductory courses, but was completely mishandled. About 75% of the grades for the class were returned the weekend before grades were due. A well organized class would never have a six week delay between when an assignment is due and when the grade is released, especially when students are expected to integrate feedback to improve subsequent assignments. The peer review system implemented to lighten the grading work for TAs was also comically unhelpful. An essay you spent 20 minutes on will likely receive the same comments and grades from peer reviewers as an essay you spent 3 hours on. Readings for topics instructors were going to speak about were not always assigned, and there was absolutely no incentive to attend class or discussion sections outside of the participation grade. I recommend taking any CS elective in place of this course unless you really need a joke class to balance a difficult schedule.</td>

Not even because it's hard, it's actually really easy. The one–page essays each week aren't hard, and you can write them just based off a couple of the readings each week so there's no incentive to go to lecture. The projects, which are just essays, are also not difficult if you just do some of the readings and a little outside research surfing the internet. Easy A. What I didn't like about the class is how disorganized it was. The TA's and professor don't answer emails, deadlines constantly changed, especially close to when an assignment would be due, and the communication between the TAs and the professor was not where it needed to be. Prof. Birnbaum didn't even know the requirements of our finally essay after the TAs had changed them. The class was frustrating because of stuff like that, and feels more like busywork and than actual learning because it's so disorganized, but its an easy A for a distro or CS majors.</td>

I am expected to submit the second project on December 8th, but without knowledge of what the graders criteria is like, I have no clue how I can improve my writing for it. The weekly essays are graded by four other students who are taking the class; I have no idea what the graders are doing while we are being required to go through our peer's essays. I have no clue why McCormick makes this a mandatory class for CS majors.

For example, there was significant confusion over the latter two projects, what their deadlines were, and whether they would allow partners or not. The statements made by the TAs often conflicted with what the syllabus said on Canvas. I understand that this is a ported–over class and slapped together quickly since you couldn't find anyone else to teach 101 this quarter, but for the future I really would just sit down for a couple of hours and clarify what time each weekly assignment will be due and when the three projects are due, and finalize that in writing on the syllabus.

Now, the grading system for this class is not only obscure but subjective. The professor does not grade you. The TAs do not entirely grade you. There is an algorithm created by Jason Hartline (Northwestern CS Professor) that uses student feedback to grade other students and as an "incentive" for you to grade accurately, when grading other students you are penalized if you do not grade the exact way the TA grades. What all this means is that your grades are being determined by other students and when peer grading you are not trying to give helpful constructive feedback, instead you are forced to begin guessing the way the TA would feel about the essay. Further, when students tried to ask for clarification with their grades, the TAs were unhelpful as was the professor. My TA though a lovely person had no idea what was going on with the grading and because it is so subjective, students have no way to advocate for themselves if their TA  gave them a grade they did not feel they deserved.

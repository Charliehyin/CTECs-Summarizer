The assignments are reasonable and can be interesting if you are engaged in them.

I was so nervous coming into the class having never programmed before. I not only left the class with a solid intro to python, but an actual desire to continue learning about computer science and possibly even taking more classes. Sarah and the peer mentors actually made the learning fun and it always felt extremely rewarding. If you put in the effort, it's not hard at all to do well in the class. But more than that, if you put in the effort, you'll leave the class a better programmer, student, and (honestly) person.</td>

I honestly enjoyed how dynamic it is because it makes you keep up with all the content. After you get over the learning curve, it feels awesome to make things work yourself! There are weekly tutorial tasks due (and you can drop 2 out of 7) and the tutorial is led by undergrad TAs that are surprisingly SUPER helpful. Weekly homework assignments and the last one was optional. 2 projects and 3 quizzes (first two mandatory; third is optional) that are pretty much midterms in terms of the format BUT they weigh a little when it comes to the overall grade. Also plenty of office hours, so you can work through anything that's confusing to you. Sarah is super nice and always answers any questions in class, so the lecture is also quite engaging (even though the lecture would often run behind what we do in tutorials and what the homework is on). It's also very useful to have that basic knowledge in a coding language because you get how a lot of things are done virtually. I took it as a Neuro requirement but would recommend it even as a class to take for fun!</td>

There's very clear guidelines on assignments which makes it easy to complete assignments, but there's also a lot of room to customize and get creative with the code you wrote. I will say that how much time I would have to spend on a given assignment was really all over the place because if you know how to do it right away it can go really quickly but if you don't know it, or your code isn't working for some reason you can't discern, you can end up banging your head against the wall for hours trying to figure it out.

Far better than CS 111 for beginners and so many opportunities for extra credit and a fair amount of leniency (can drop 1/3 quizzes, 1 homework, 2 tutorials) so if you put in some work you should be able to achieve an A. Prof is wonderfully supportive and stresses how approachable coding can be/that the course is for beginners.</td>

Often times the homework will be extensions of what is covered in class, so going to office hours is a must. It would also help to start homework early as it will often take a couple of hours to complete. I am a non major but this class peaked my interest in programming so I will definitely use these skills in the future. Highly recommend for those who are interested in dipping their toes into CS!</td>

Took the class so that I didn't have to take math, I regret nothing. Wasn't interested in coding before, but decided to enroll anyways because I'm chronically on the computer. Can confidently say that it made me more interested in coding (while also giving me the reality check that computer science is definitely not my thing). The professor is kind, and the lectures are interesting. Some of the TAs are helpful, some of them will just look at you more confused than you are looking at them.</td>

The course is not very challenging if you do what he asks you to do. As long as you read through everything he sends out and complete the assignments (with which you can find help from the TAs, professor Bain himself, or the PAs), you will do well. As someone who had no CS experience, the concepts are not very challenging, but if you get confused, it's important to get help immediately because the concepts are cumulative. The course load includes lectures, some pre–recorded lectures that take about 45 minutes max, tutorials that are graded on participation if you come in person, homework (which are closely related to the tutorial material), and two projects which are a bit larger and more difficult. Overall, very fun and doable course.</td>

It gets better with office hours but I've never needed to do so much outside work/go to office hours as much as I have for this class.</td>

Professor Bain was super clear and precise in his instruction, almost to a fault. Many times it felt like he was lecturing to a class of elementary schoolers and it felt like he spent a lot of time on even very basic ideas. But it was good though in order to make sure everyone was following him. As long as you kept track of everything on the canvas, the course was good, but there were a lot of moving parts: asynchronous lectures, quizzes, mini–quizzes, tutorials, and projects. Would reccomend this course for anyone looking for a thorough introduction to python</td>

It was not work–free or a blow–off in my opinion, but the work was not difficult and sometimes even fun. Bain is also a great instructor and made all the concepts very approachable. Personally, it sometimes felt like some things were explained too much, but I can still see how the extra detail could help for people who have more trouble getting the intuition for Python and CS in general. He was also very willing to help whenever we ran into issues. The quizzes were not hard, and the lowest grade is also dropped (which did also mean you could skip one of the three quizzes and the 0 would be dropped). No final exam was also a plus.</td>

I lived in office hours and the PMs were so helpful in their support so that I could complete the code for projects and homeworks. Since the majority of the grade is comprised of homework and office hours, getting high marks on them is important. Other than that, the course is designed for students to succeed, there are many chances to get a good grade if you put in the effort to get help if you need it.</td>

However, I feel like the class content is not useful at all beyond the class and I truly struggled. I spent every single week going to office hours. Connor is a good professor and he's witty and kind but I felt like the content we saw in class was really different from the assignments and the quizzes were really hard even if I studied. So if you're a comp sci person, you probably won't struggle as much but if you're not, be wary of this class.</td>

I have never coded before but Connor was so great at lecturing clearly for inexperienced coders and explaining concepts. He is super passionate and kind and is always so happy to help. It seems that some people's minds are just more suited for coding than others, because many find the class easy but some need to put a little extra work in, but an A is easily achievable. Monday classes were lectures (but recorded on panopto so can skip if needed), Wednesdays were tutorial days with prerecorded lectures (need to watch to take miniquiz, also should attend tutorial). Fridays were lecture days with miniquiz. If you did the tutorials and miniquizzes in person you automatically got full credit, otherwise you would be graded for accuracy, so best to attend Wed+Fri class. Grading was Tutorials 15%, Mini–Quizzes 5%, Weekly homeworks 25%, 2 Projects 25%, and 3 Quizzes (midterms) 30%. You could drop your lowest of each category except for projects, which is super generous and means you don't need to take the last midterm if you do well on the first two.</td>

I took Comp Sci 110 the quarter before this class, so this seemed like a breeze in comparison to that one. I also think that Python is a language that's easy to pick up. Professor Bain is a great instructor if you're new to computer science, but he also offers more complicated subjects for people with more experience. The homeworks are straight–forward but sometimes a little time–intensive. I won't lie, the project was extremely stressful for me, it was a lot of work but it's doable and there are so many office hours that it's easy to get help if you need it. Overall, this is a fun and easy class and a great introduction to computer science.</td>

Professor Bain knows so much and he is willing to share all of it with the students. The assignments are never too hard, you really don't have to spend more than 3 hours per week on this class. I'd say if you want to get in to compsci, take CS 111. If you want an easier A, take CS 110. If you want both, take CS 110 and do some research on the outside, always be teaching yourself to almost stay ahead of the class.</td>

It's not impossible, and I still got an A. The class is very heavy on participation, which is nice. However, the things we learn in class are 10 times easier than the HW's or projects. The quizzes were okay, but the extra credit on the projects were so helpful. It literally saved my grades. Additionally, I rotted in office hours for HW because I suck at coding. Dr. Bain is so nice and is kind to beginners.</td>

The class is well designed and not too difficult for people who have zero comp sci background. It does a good job giving an overview of important aspects of programming and Python, showing you the basics and where it would go deeper in a next level course but not getting too complex. Lectures are well organized and easy to follow, there are plenty of opportunities to practice and get help, homeworks are very reasonable and effective, and quizzes are very fair and do a good job hitting on key topics. Bain is super nice and a great teacher. <br>Also a great class if you have an otherwise heavy courseload; it's not difficult to get an A if you do the work, and if you pay attention in class, expect to only put in 2–3 hours outside of class per week. Highly recommend!</td>

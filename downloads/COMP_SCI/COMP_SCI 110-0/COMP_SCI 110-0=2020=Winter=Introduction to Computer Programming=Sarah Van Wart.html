Any reproduction, republication or redistribution of this site's content is prohibited without the express permission of Northwestern University.<br><br>In the last two weeks of Winter Quarter 2020, students were strongly encouraged and subsequently required to leave campus as a result of a public health emergency. Faculty redesigned and rescheduled final assessments, in some cases overnight. As a result,&nbsp;CTEC&nbsp;response rates may be lower, and quantitative feedback may be less robust or may reflect the turmoil of the time.<br><br>For more information about the CTEC Guidelines please visit our website: <a href="http://www.northwestern.edu/ctec/guidelines/index.html">http://www.northwestern.edu/ctec/guidelines/index.html</a><br>&nbsp;</span>

There is definitely a difficult spike introduced with almost every new assignment, but it is manageable if you have the time to commit to office hours. As a CS beginner, time spent in office hours was absolutely essential and I often couldn't even figure out where to start without them. I would keep this time commitment in mind when thinking about taking this course. Lectures became more essential towards the end of the quarter as Project 2 approached. If you do the homework and commit time to the projects, this class isn't too tough to get a good grade in. It's a fun distro if you can fit it into your schedule. I feel like I learned a lot about Python and it's enough to carry me on to any independent project I might want to do with programming later on.</td>

Took it for a formal studies distro and made me briefly consider if I should minor in CS. Sarah is probably the sweetest person on this planet and teaches you a very informative run–down of Python. She's energetic and a great lecturer. The only downside is that you have to go to OH every week consistently to understand the homework assignments, which are very advanced in comparison to the lectures. The midterm wasn't that bad, and she lets you double–count it for the final. Just go to class and OH, and you will be fine.</td>

Office hours are so necessary as it's usually hard to start assignments by yourself (each time we start something new it's SO overwhelming until you figure it out). The first few weeks are a lot, but overall SUCH A GOOD course. You don't need to go to lectures if that's not how you learn – Sarah is very ok with you learning however you are meant to learn.</td>

The course is well designed in that key concepts are taught early in the quarter and the second part of the quarter is more focused on creative projects and applications! The creative projects were thoughtfully designed and made learning to code fun. My programming friends who heard what topics were covered and projects were assigned were always impressed because they were topics and projects that professional programmers actually engage in. Lots of support and reminders that everyone can program were given. The instructor and the student mentors were phenomenal in trouble shooting and providing assistance.</td>

The course would not be as amazing without her instruction. Lecture is a helpful balance of instruction on concepts that may be foreign to most of us and then applying these things in demo activities. A lot of review material is provided to prepare for exams. Completing work in this class made me feel capable of learning computer science further, even if I had difficulties with course work &amp; time management due to mental health issues. Regardless, I am so happy I took this class. You learn more than you think you were capable of, even if it's only the beginning of what you can know. That's inspiring.</td>

She made lectures funny, but understood that not everyone learns through coming to lecture so it wasn't necessary. It was always a nice feeling when I finally got the code right, doing the homework didn't always feel like work, it was more a puzzle. Office hours are SO helpful when you don't know what you're doing, the peer mentors are there to help and they do such a great job.

The course has six homework assignments, two projects, and two exams (one is optional and you can just double your score from the first exam if you wish). If you have no previous experience with coding and you want to do well in the class, you must go to office hours. The homework and the projects take a lot of time and a lot of times beginners won't be able to figure out what is wrong with their code. Office hours are frequent but they are very time consuming because the class was very large and there were not enough TAs to help everyone at once. If you want to be efficient, go to office hours at the very start or way before the homework or project is due to avoid lines and save time. Looking back, I got something out of this course but I probably wouldn't take it again. I don't know if there was that much here that I could not have learned how to do on my own or with the help of a website.</td>

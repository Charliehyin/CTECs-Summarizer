In a class centered on the production of code at one of the most basic levels, she had trouble even teaching on that.

The homework assignments were fairly interesting, and they helped me learn a lot about Python libraries and processing data. The lectures, however, were not very helpful. The skills and knowledge needed to do the homework were often not taught in the lectures, and instead, you have to follow links in the homework to learn the material. Further, this class feels sloppily put together at times. The professor is often unable to help with library and installation issues with Python, instead recommending stack overflow. Homeworks occasionally included directions and comments from previous year's classes that are no longer relevant. And finally, there would be occasional bugs in the libraries used in the starter code.</td>

I highly reccommend. There are weekly homeworks but no tests or quizes and no final. The homeworks can be tricky but if you put the time in you will do well. Plus, there is extra credit offered at the end of the course if you missed any points on the homeworks. I liked the strcuture of this class and think I learned a lot about coding.</td>

The professor does not go over anything useful pertaining to the actual CS concepts in lecture, so don't waste your time going to lecture. I pretty much had to figure out all of the lecture content by myself through friends and the internet, which was irritating. The code is pretty manageable though, and I liked not having exams (just HWs and weekly group assignments). Some of the homework programs can be a bit time consuming, so I'd recommend starting a few days before the deadline.</td>

We were primarily graded on based on weekly homework assignments, and additionally on weekly in–class group coding assignments. The assignments aren't particularly hard and an A is definitely achievable with good effort.  Professor Compton is very kind and demonstrates passion for the material. However, the lectures often felt unrelated to the material, and I wouldn't say I learned a lot in this course. I definitely found the TA office hours helpful in completing the assignments.</td>

Hours gone just sitting at this incredibly long file trying to understand what the professor wanted. The PMs who had the office hours were not given any sort of answers or guidelines too so all they could say was that it seemed like the output you got should be right but you would never know and sometime they were wrong simply because no one is inside the professor's head knowing what they were expecting. This was avoidable in the beginning when there were a number of checks put into the assignment, but as soon as those started going away you could easily think you were doing something right and check for it only to find out after it was graded you misunderstood the assignment and there was no mercy for that.</td>

All I'll say is I'm glad she's gone. She is not a good lecturer and was rude over email. I came into this class knowing Python from 110 and this class was an adequate amount of challenging. I was introduced to new concepts and capabilities of python through the homework. I also went to office hours, which I highly recommend!! Like seriously. There is no need for you to struggle through the homework and get a bad grade. I went to office hours if I was struggling with a question and I learned a lot on what I was doing wrong through the TAs and was able to get a good grade because I got help.</td>

It is a big shame as I expected to come out of class expecting to know basic Python. I wanted to learn Python, but the teaching just didn't seem to echo that promise. Now, even though I completed the class, I still have to relearn it for other classes.</td>

However, my biggest complaint with this class is that Prof Kate prefaces the assignments with "you will spend a lot of time figuring out other people's code in the real world", which is honestly very true and a valuable skill to have, but then proceeds to hand you a ~1000 line assignment file. It's not that you have to code a lot but that there are so many comments and helper functions. I would have much preferred a separate documentation file than having the important details left in comments throughout the code. Aside from having to constantly find your place in the file, the tasks are *sometimes* ordered chronologically by which ones she thinks you should code first. And doing the assignments feels like Mad Libs because I'm filling out these pieces of code in a way that Prof Kate wants me to fill them out so that everything else works rather than doing it in a way I feel makes sense. <br><br>I like Prof Kate and nothing against her but honestly I wish they would just remove 150 from the core requirements because you really do not learn anything you wouldn't learn in 111/211/214.</td>

It really depends on how much of a coding background you have, but for someone who has some experience already, this class is not very difficult.

Homework is one assignment per week generally due on Wednesdays, and each Monday class is dedicated to completing a much smaller assignment in a group setting that's graded for completion. NO EXAMS, although that may change from year to year. Level of difficulty was quite fair for me coming out of CS 111 as all assignments were challenging but doable if you put in a few hours and use your resources (peer mentors, professors, and especially the internet). Content coverage in the lectures is somewhat vague but it was okay for me considering it's a lot of content already covered in 110 and 111. Overall this is a good, pretty laid back course and I would definitely recommend it.</td>

Only take this class if you want to get more practice doing Python and you don't mind a slightly time–consuming assignment each week. But honestly you can learn everything this class has to offer on your own just as well.  Overall, the class just didn't seem organized––it just seemed like a random assignment each week.

I do wish the group work was structured differently — I'm not opposed to working with others,  but I didn't come into the class knowing anyone else, and since I missed a couple group days early on, it made it a lot harder to find a group to work with every week. It felt like I was imposing at that point instead of helping, which was clearly not the goal of having group work.  So group work days became extremely annoying, but the actual weekly assignments were pretty decent and taught useful skills.</td>

Honestly, I don't feel strongly either way. If you haven't learned by now, most CS lecture classes at NU are kind of a waste of time and you'll have to learn how to code on your own. This class could not have exemplified that idea more strongly. The fact that Dr. Compton had to incentivize students to come to a mere half of the lectures with attendance/bonus points shows you how pointless class lecture was. I feel bad that she didn't really have many students show up, but it's hard to fault NU students when they have other important stuff to do and what is being talked about in lecture literally has little to no relevance for the weekly assignments. The one bright spot in the class is that there are no exams (midterm nor final). Just 10 weekly assignments/problem sets.</td>

And a lot of bad things: atrocious timing of office hours, apathetic and annoying instruction by professor Compton, and an extreme necessity to attend several office hours. I cannot understate this enough, going to office hours is an absolute necessity because the homeworks are so tedious and difficult that you basically have to do all of it in office hours. This pain is exaggerated by horrendous timing of office hours, I mean its actually confusing how they screw this up so bad, there was clearly no oversight on the PMs to make sure the office hours were at good times. There would be office hours during class (like whhhhaaaat how am I supposed to go to those) every week there was like a 2 hour block with like 4 office hours going on at the same time. These weird timings make it hard to get homework done because you need to go to office hours and some of them are completely out of the picture as they are at atrocious times. The PMs also switch their office hours without notice at last minute which can screw up your schedule because you planned around going to a certain one and all of a sudden you can't go because a PM was lazy. You NEED to find a PM you trust and go to their office hours every week for this class to be good, luckily I did  Aining was amazing and got me through the class.</td>

If you've already taken CS 110, you're not going to learn too many new things, but it's a good way to reenforce what you already know and get more comfortable using python. Professor Compton wants everyone to get a good grade and her policies reflect that: there are no tests and the final provides 50 points of extra credit opportunity.</td>

In class attendance was low, people annoyingly talked during lecture, and overall, the class was a bit disorganized. A good basic engineering if you want to find a few friends to take it with but as a junior with basic programming language having never taken a CS class at NU, it was still pretty easy and doesn't need the prereqs in my opinion. Professor Kate clearly has a love of teaching and of sharing her CS adventures with the class.</td>

I was pretty comfortable coding in Python before this class, so I can't speak to how difficult the class would be for someone unfamiliar with the language, but I really appreciated that the homework gave us the opportunity to explore real–world applications, like web–scraping, analyzing data, etc. Professor Compton was very encouraging and accommodating, and certainly made working in CS seem less intimidating.</td>

I took the first class with Sarah Osley and she was very organized and taught the class well. <br>I do not feel like I learnt in this class. What a waste of time! The instructor would make changes to an assignment on the day it is due. She would focus more on the application rather than inculcating good coding skills to us. People barely showed up to class. The class felt so isolating. The class material wasn't hard though.<br><br>Take the class with friends and it would be a better experience cos you can learn from each other and better yourselves.

The homeworks were helpful in giving examples of the base elements of Python, and I think they were the most effective part of the course. Kate Compton's teaching is pretty enthusiastic, but overall I did not get much out of the lectures. The in class explanations just did not give me much good context on the material and it was honestly easier to puzzle through the homeworks and read documentation online. Still, not a terrible class, and at times I had fun.</td>

If you have to take this, I feel sorry for you. It's not the worst class in the world, but the lectures do not provide much information since they're usually filled with pointless information that doesn't really teach us well. The only thing that kept me alive for the assignments was campuswire since everyone had the same questions.

It was hard to pay attention in the class and while I understand her effort in us seeing how applicable Python can be to the world, I really just needed her to cover what we needed to know to complete our weekly assignments so I could spend less time Googling how to do code in Python. She also reused a lot of old assignments and would have typos/old instructions mixed in with the new, and it would cause unnecessary confusion for me. However, the class didn't take too much of my time and the assignments were easy, and I do believe that with a moderate amount of effort, an A in easily secured in this class. It is just too easy to feel unmotivated to try when things are so unclear and you have to rely on TAs, Google, or your classmates for everything.</td>

I didn't attend the majority of lectures because I felt like they were not helpful for the assignments. Lectures and class material also didn't feel structured or organised. There were also a lot of bugs and issues with our assignments that I feel like should have been identified before releasing them. However, this class is all assignment based so as long as you put in the time or have people to work with you should be able to do well. There are no exams or quizzes.</td>

I understood most of the assignments because I took another python class. This class taught me absolutely nothing, Dr Compton can be aggressive when things don’t go the way she likes which is very uncomfortable for students who are exploring computer science for the first time. Very discouraging for aspiring CS students who have little experience.</td>

I took as someone with strong computer science background but never having taken a Python course and wanting to be much more comfortable with using it. I wouldn't say this course necessarily did that since it mostly taught syntax above anything else. I didn't watch any lectures past the first 2 weeks and was able to do the assignments in an hour or two.

Her lectures are incredibly disorganized, confusing, and not very applicable to the assignments.

The nice thing about this class is that your grade is solely based off of homework assignments. You can work with your peers, attend office hours, etc. The homeworks explore interesting concepts but are again impossible to decipher. There are always typos and errors in the assignment code and it is often difficult to figure out what you are being asked to do.

Unfortunately, if you are taking this class with Kate Compton, you are out of luck when it comes to instruction. Prof. Compton provides some of the most boring/confusing/unrelated lectures I've ever heard. I watched the lecture room go from full, to half full, to nearly empty in the first two weeks of class. I ended up teaching myself Python, and attending almost none of the lectures. Compton is a wonderful, funny, kind person, but she seriously does not know how to teach. Her lecture slides are incredibly cluttered, memes pulling your focus away from the actual important elements (don't worry though, the important elements don't really make sense anyways). She talks in a way where if you zoned out, it would SOUND like she's teaching CS, but when you really pay attention, it's sort of just a series of sentences semi–related to the lecture topic. My advice to anyone taking this course with Compton is this: Look at the lecture slides she posts on Canvas to see what the topic for the day is, and watch a 15–20 minute youtube video that teaches you said topic. I guarantee you will learn python this way, and be able to easily complete the assignments. The hardest part about the assignments anyways is deciphering the instructions (they are either very vague or hidden amongst 4 million useless comments.)</td>

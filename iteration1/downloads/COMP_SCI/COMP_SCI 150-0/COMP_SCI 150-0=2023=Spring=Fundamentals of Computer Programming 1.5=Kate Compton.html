But the method it was given was really weird and not effective. Most of class time is just random facts about python and not actual demonstration (live coding) or explanation of components of python. The homeworks were just already fully written, super–complicated long lines of code and we just had to complete some tasks within. It really did not focus on teaching how to apply coding from scratch, like how we will be expected to do in the real world.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_0db8eb0e-0324-449b-a29d-edbef2c133a3">This was a mickey mouse course. Absolutely should not be required for the CS major. The course was advertised as an introduction to object–oriented programming and the Python language. Did not learn any of either. We didn't touch how to initialize a class in python until like week 6. Professor Compton is nice and you can tell she genuinely means well, and she definitely puts a lot of time into trying to help people and create the lecture slides. Sadly, you learn very little in this class. 100% project based, and it covers a wide breadth of topics in computer science. Assignments are all in python. However, none of the assignments go into meaningful depth into any of the various topics covered–web scraping, machine learning, etc. so you just get a very brief preview of cool things you can do in computer science, but not enough to learn anything meaningful. Would be much better suited as a course for non–majors. If you have any previous cs experience whatsoever, you should be allowed to test out of this class. Lots of kids in this class just didn't take AP CS and thus had a dead weight class. But, it is pretty easy, so if you need a free class and want to get very brief exposure to some different topics, then this could be a good class for you. Still, since I was hoping to learn a lot about the Python language and OOP, this class was not good for that.</td>

That is the only way to make it through this course. <br><br>For background, I had no python experience coming into this course, and the only real CS experience I had before was in CS 111. Maybe that affects how I went through this class. Regardless, it is a struggle to get through and incredibly frustrating. While the only grades are from group and individual assignments, don't let that system fool you. The weekly individual assignments are incredibly dense packages with hundreds of lines of code, where you'll spend too much time just looking for where your work is supposed to go. The instructions are incredibly unclear (so make sure you look at the asserts to understand what the code is asking you to do). Assignment tasks are not linear, and you'll struggle with one exercise for hours before realizing you have to finish the next task for the previous one to pass all its tests. Problem is, unless you go to pm office hours or ask someone who's already done the assignment, you will never find out, because the professor doesn't include this context in her assignments. On several assignments, there are also really important tricks – ones that sometimes are the only way to write the code successfully – that the professor also never mentions, neither in lecture nor on the assignment. Again, you'll need to hope you go to the right peer mentor or ask the right classmate to grab the tricks, as they are often incredibly counterintuitive (e.g. choosing True as the default return case as opposed to False). <br><br>One of the course's main objectives is to teach you how to work with difficult colleagues, managers and clients. In that regard, it unfortunately succeeded. I'll let you guess who that difficult colleague/manager/client was.</td>

She reuses the same files every quarter and changes them slightly, but they aren't properly updated so you should be careful if you see something weird. For example, instructions saying to call a function that you have to write in a later task, incorrect parameter/argument descriptions, buggy test code/asserts, etc. It's also very difficult to debug as her homework assignments contain all the functions inside one super long file, rather than splitting it up into different files to test separately.

Lectures don't really teach that much about actual Python. I never went to class except for Mondays for the group activity. There's a LOT of office hours to get help if you need it. Assignments would take me like ~4ish hours every week to complete, so not too bad, especially considering I'm easily distracted. You should definitely try to take it with a friend or try and meet someone early on to work with.</td>

It was 3 50 minute lectures a week plus a relatively time consuming weekly assignment and an in class group assignment every Monday. Without questions, the assignments were the highlight of this class. They were very well put together, and they get progressively more difficult both as you get through the assignment (they're organized in "tasks," so you solve one problem and then go on to do another), and as you get through the class. I definitely learned a lot about debugging and about how to get better at coding independently and as a group because of those assignments. <br>The same cannot be said for the lectures in this class. Professor Compton was very focused in just getting through her slides each day. She rarely engaged with students during lecture, never really asking if anyone had questions, prioritizing getting through the content she had for the day. Though the lecture content sort of related to the assignments we were doing, it never seemed essential that I was there. We were introduced to all these new concepts, but we never actually got to digest what they meant. <br>Bottom line, the assignments were great, lectures not so much. Very fair grading and late work policies too!</td>

Definitely go to office hours because the peer mentors are extremely helpful with the assignments. The course is mainly just group assignments and the weekly assignments so it wasn't that stressful. It was only stressful the two days before the assignments were due since I started late. I did not go to class at all and still did well.</td>

Honestly, if you have some previous coding experience, you do not need to watch all the lectures to complete the assignments. This class is only 9 weekly assignments and like 8 short "in–class" assignments that can be done outside of class. Pretty easy A if you just complete all the assignments.</td>

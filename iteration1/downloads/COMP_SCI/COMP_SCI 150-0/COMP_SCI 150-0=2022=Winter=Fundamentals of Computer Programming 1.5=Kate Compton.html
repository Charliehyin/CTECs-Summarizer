Not only are the assignments usually really fun to do, especially as someone with no prior background in Python, they also take relatively little time to do. Prof. Compton really guides the students in class with numerous comments and check–expects to base their code on. There are a lot of potentially useful skills she teaches, even dipping into applying machine learning concepts. Even then, the code is very intuitive as a lot of the difficult and tedious parts of those concepts are already written for you. Class participation is very doable as well. Overall, there shouldn't be a reason that you can't get an A in the class, with the amount of help you get in the class. Also, no exams at all, with 9 assignments and participation as the only determiners to your grade.</td>

The assignments take a good amount of time, so start them early and then go to office hours for help.

However, if you're looking to actually learn python and the "fundamentals" of CS, I would recommend skipping this course or taking some free online bootcamp if you're motivated enough. This class was a waste of time and money. I honestly cannot name a single thing I learned and actually have an adequate understanding of. I learned some python syntax and stuff I guess, but that could've been easily learned by taking a free online course. Professor Compton "teaches" random topics in lectures, which sometimes seem interesting but she explains them so vaguely you won't get anything out of it. This class reminds me of AP CS principles, except I learned more in that class and it was formatted better. Lecture topics have nothing to do with assignments. In addition, Professor Compton didn't grade any of our assignments until the last couple of weeks of the quarter, which was annoying since I had no idea how I was actually doing in the class and it's hard to start new assignments if you aren't sure if the methods you used in previous ones were correct. I think this class needs to be reformatted to include actual teaching of topics relevant to assignments in lectures and it would be great if assignments were a little more intellectually stimulating since it seemed as though they got easier as the quarter went on. This is an amazing class to take if you're not interested in CS and just want a blow off class because there are no quizzes, midterms, finals, or projects. I do not feel as though this class has prepared me to take higher level CS classes and I may as well have skipped this course and taken a 200–level one since this class didn't strengthen my previous knowledge and certainly didn't add any.</td>

However (now the following will definitely be biased), by being enrolled in 211 at the same time, I spent 90% of my time focusing on that class and essentially 150 became my "side class." I basically forgot about it for the whole week until I had to do one of the assignments. I will say that the lectures can be quite boring and that 211 is more interesting. Again! I am biased as there are those who dreaded 211 and loved 150, but although 211 was a time–suck, I believe my programming skills really developed there because of the challenge. If you desire, you can skip the lectures and google python concepts as python is VERY easy to self–teach. Would I take this class again? Maybe not. But, on the bright side you can learn if software development and high–level coding is for you (as it definitely didn't pique my interest much). Nonetheless, an easy A class and because of that I will rest my case.</td>

It's not a very difficult class, but essentially everything you learn (the language taught is Python) you could easily learn in less time on your own. Prof. Kate was nice, but a lot of her lectures––especially later in the quarter––were entirely irrelevant to our assignments in class. I didn't go to class at all for probably the last four weeks of class and still got 100% on all of my assignments. If you have to take this class, it's not bad, and not too much work. There are a lot of TA office hours that are very helpful for completing the assignments, and the assignments themselves are not too hard, especially if you work on them with other people.

Most of the syntax and nitty–gritty of assignments are explained through the homework. Also homework is 90% of your grade, and 10% is in–class participation</td>

For me tho, this class taught me a lot, and the generous extra credit on the last assignment was nice so I didn't need to worry too much about getting good grades, just on getting better at coding.

Though I did find many of the assignments to be interesting and fun, they were rewritten from previous quarters, where (I believe) Professor Sood had written the assignments. Thus, on several occasions, there were strange bugs in the assignments, and it was often somewhat hard to tell if the code I had written caused the bugs, or if this was a problem in the starter code that everybody was having. Beyond that, essentially all of the learning that you'll experience in this class is through the assignments. The lectures really did not cover much that would help you complete the assignments, and when difficulties showed up in the assignments, online resources came through greatly. Though I went to lecture, I greatly appreciate Professor Compton adding an asynchronous and remote option to this class.<br>In terms of difficulty, this class is nothing to stress over. If you start the assignments shortly after they're assigned, you will really have absolutely nothing to worry about. Grades are made up of these assignments and several participation activities, which can be completed asynchronously. If something does go wrong, there is a fair deal of extra credit offered at the end of the course. Ultimately, I do think that this class can even be taken as a fifth class, for it was not demanding.<br>If you're on the fence about taking this class or going straight into 214, I would say that it purely depends on your schedule. If you have the time to take this class and want a more relaxed class to lighten your schedule's load, I would absolutely recommend it.</td>

This course introduces you to the many applications of CS in the practical world and for that Kate is great, but it's really only an overview and feels a bit superficial. Python–wise I wanted deeper dives – things a "power user" might use. Assignments felt like busywork and was a translation of many concepts I learned in 111. We get introduced to a lot of neat packages and applications but most of it is implemented for us, so what's left is reading the docs, cleanup work involving list comprehensions and finding the "best" of something.</td>

But after that I got the hang of it and it became a lot easier. I did have to teach a lot of the actual python syntax to myself using the resources the professor provided on canvas but python is pretty human–friendly so it wasn't hard. Going to office hours really helped and it actually saved my life in this class. Overall I learned a lot more about cs in general and python specifically so I'm glad I took it</td>

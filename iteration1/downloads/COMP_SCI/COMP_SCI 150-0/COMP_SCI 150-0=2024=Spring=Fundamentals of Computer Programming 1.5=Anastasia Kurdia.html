You get a drop on a quiz, lab, and 4 drops for attendance grades. The quizzes are reasonably difficult. Anastasia is a good teacher imo.

Labs every single week that take up a significant amount of time to complete, 3 in–class quizzes that are cumulative and there are like 3–4 FRQs for each quiz that lowkey are very difficult.  on top of all this there was a final programming project that she didn't release instruction on until literally less than a week before it was due and that was the hardest part of the quarter it's actually ridiculous we were expected to complete the project like it was a weekly lab with everything else going on during finals as well. it was honestly so  unmotivating to be in this class and for anyone actually interested about going into CS it would be a HUGE deterrent imo.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_626a77e7-97f0-48d2-a532-e935e05784eb">Easy but tedious class. Professor Kurdia is terrible at teaching, lectures don't really make much sense so be prepared to self learn. However, Python is a very easy language and you only do the basics. The instructions for labs are really poorly written, so they are really confusing when getting started. But once you figure out the first part, most of the time the labs are very repetitive, so it gets easier from there. Overall the coursework and quizzes weren't too bad but the teaching was awful. Also, she doesn't answer all questions on the discussion board and I think she purposely leaves the most important and urgent questions unanswered out of pure spite. And don't expect a reply to direct messages to the professor before 3 weeks.</td>

The only thing is as the quarter went on, labs were released late with no extension of the deadline and the autograder wasn't configured on time and students would have to wait to see whether their code passed the tests. Some of the tests are really nit–picky and expect a certain output, which was a little annoying. The quizzes were doable with a lockdown browser that had you answer multiple choice questions and write code by hand.</td>

The weekly labs aren't hard to do well on, especially if you pay a decent amount of attention during class. Also, there's office hours every week and the TA's are very good at helping you with code. There are three quizzes total and you can drop one of them. Try to do well on the first two if you want a good grade – the quizzes are cumulative and and so each one is harder than the last.

I learned a lot about Python, and since I'm in McCormick, knowing Matlab made it easier to learn Python for the first time.

This class was an introduction to Python. For students who have lots of programming experience or already know Python, this class was pretty easy. Even for students with less experience who haven't done Python before, it wasn't so hard. There is no textbook for this class. In class, there are lectures and attendance questions, and sometimes a practice assignment. The practice assignments are pretty easy, and they are worth 15% of the grade overall. Lectures are mandatory, enforced by the attendance questions in class. There are weekly at–home programming labs (which can be done in pairs) worth 45% (you can drop one), and 3 in–class quizzes (taken on your own laptop with LockDown Browser during the normal lecture period) throughout the class worth 35% (you can drop one). The at–home labs are pretty easy since you have a whole week to work on them. The in–class quizzes are easy if you study for them. At the end of the course, there is a final project which is worth 5% of the grade. This project was very hard compared to the rest of the class assignments, but it was only worth 5%. The professor and the many TAs hold in–person and online office hours all the time. I would recommend this class to anyone looking for a nice introduction to Python that isn't too hard but isn't all busywork.</td>

First, the labs (homeworks) are poorly worded, so often hours will be spent on clarification between you and the autograder for the homework. The autograder is not as bad as it seems, as often it is accurate and fair. Second, the first midterm (Quiz 0) is very important, as the lowest quiz gets dropped. Third, the final project is impossible, but it is only worth 5% of your final grade so you can tank it. Overall, it is a good intro course to python and the class is taught well.

There couldve been no professor for this class and I wouldnt have known. The TA's were helpful though they answer questions well during office hours.

Labs would often have very vague instructions, and the online grading would penalize even the smallest of mistakes, which was often confusing when trying to debug code. Prof. Kurdia was nice and wanted us to do well, but her lectures were often unclear on what was important to know and what wasn't, and she wasn't very communicative online. She also didn't give us any information on the final project until a week before it was due, which caused a lot of undue stress. Peer mentors weren't much better – I'd often get stonewalled in office hours, or they just wouldn't show up. The quizzes were fairly easy, but they tested on small syntax things, which I feel like isn't a good thing to test on, because those are super easy to find and fix, while questions on big–picture ideas would actually test our knowledge of how code works. My advice is to find someone to do labs with and get them done early. The workload isn't that bad, and an A is definitely gettable, but I can't really recommend the class – it may be more efficient and easy to learn Python on your own rather than take this class, which is really a shame.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_626a77e7-97f0-48d2-a532-e935e05784eb">This class was NOT it. I came in with some previous Python knowledge from another class I took at Northwestern, however, I barely learned anything new and have no idea why I still had to take this one. I considered myself lucky though, because without my previous knowledge, I would've not survived. A lot of things learned in class were hard to understand simply because the lecturing style was hard to follow and digest, and not a lot of examples were provided. When examples were provided, sometimes they were only 'trick' scenarios which is so confusing for someone who just learned the concept 2 minutes ago. Simply looking at already constructed code on a presentation slide in addition to an unclear spoken explanation made it extremely difficult to stay focused in class and was super unmotivating. In addition, there was also a strong emphasis on discovering things for yourself, which meant that some of the more complicated concepts (recursion, oop etc.) were given to us in a worksheet style FIRST, before we learned anything about it, that we needed to complete on our own. I honestly don't understand what good that does without any basic prior learning beforehand. I will also add that the Lab/homework instructions were often unclear and sometimes understanding what you even needed to do took longer than actually doing the problems because instructions were so convoluted. The lab was provided as a really big file of Python code where you had to first SEARCH for the question through the millions of comments which made the code overwhelming, then understand its wording. I understand that this is sometimes to 'put us in the real world' but it is frankly extremely confusing for a bunch of people just starting out. Even after confirming with the professor about the specifics of the question, the answer I was given was sometimes wrong and I ended up just hardcoding for a very specific case was not mentioned in the question instructions. Not to mention, on EdStem (the place where we could ask questions), our questions took a really long time to get answered, especially before the final project was due. And omg the final project, which we were supposed to get 2–3 weeks to work on on the syllabus, was given to us 1 week before it was due in the midst of everything else we needed to do for other classes. This also happened for the labs/hw toward the end of the quarter, when the instructions were dropped less than a week before it was due. Literally only 1/2 PMs answered majority of the questions EdStem as well and even as I'm looking at it right now, there are so many questions that are unanswered. Practice in your own time using W3 schools or Geeks for Geeks before taking this class. Only plus about this class is the amount of drops for things which makes it nice. While Anatasia is very nice and is a great person who seems to care about her students, I strongly believe that I do not vibe with her instruction style and organization of the course personally.</td>

I found her to be totally incompetent which is pretty shocking considering this is quite a basic level course. She mandated in the syllabus that you do not contact her by email which I think is ludicrous. She is paid by this university to teach students yet denies students to use her university provided channel of contact. She requests that we direct message her on a separate platform which I used. However, I messaged her at least 5 times through the quarter and not once did I ever receive a response. When I went into office hours, she admitted to seeing all of my messages and complained about how she can't deal with every single student's requests. In addition, her lectures were completely useless and unrelated to the labs and assignments. All of the labs are written by professors that taught the course in the past and it appears she doesn't even understand them fully herself and often can't provide aid.<br>In terms of difficulty, this course is not hard. I came in with somewhat sufficient coding experience and didn't struggle with anything. If you don't have very much experience and only took COMP_SCI 110, it will be a little harder but still totally doable especially if you find some friends to help. You are also allowed to do any assignment with a partner which is a great option if you are less confident in your coding skills. There is a lot of lenience built in – there is only a 1% deduction for late assignments and they are open for 2 weeks meaning that even if you turn a lab in a week late, you would still get an A. Also, your 1 lowest lab (out of 7), 1 lowest quiz (out of 3), and 4 lowest practice assignments (1 pt exercises graded for completion, pretty much just attendance) are dropped. If you complete all the work, you will leave with a very solid understanding of the basic functions of Python and be able to confidently put Python on your resume so I would highly recommend this for non CS majors that took 110.<br><br>tldr: The professor sucks but the class is quite easy with a lot of lenience built in.</td>

It was more than 111, which I did not expect from previous CTECs. However, it doesn't really take time because it's hard, just because it's not really clear what to do on the assignments. Something about filling in the last 10% of a program really does not work for me. PMs are also not always super helpful, but do go to OH, in person if possible.</td>

There was scarcely one week this quarter that I didn't feel extremely confused with the assignment. If you only took 110 before this, expect this class to be a HUGE jump in difficulty. Class time on Monday is the only thing that's necessary or helpful to attend because we do small group assignments. On Wednesday, we go over the assignment that's due the following Wednesday, which was funny because most people I knew hadn't even started the assignment that was due that night. Fridays are just kind of vague theoretical lectures about computers and algorithms that are very loosely connected to the material. Each assignment covers totally disparate aspects of Python so I never felt like I became confident in anything. Prof. Compton has made so many cool projects, and I was really hoping I'd get some applicable skills out of this class to be able to do some similar things. But I came out of it still feeling like those projects were so out of reach for me.</td>

As someone who felt like they had a reasonable grasp of Python before taking this course, I was surprised by how much I learned. I did not necessarily learn a lot about actual programming in Python, but I did learn about computer science as a whole. I would recommend that you actually go to the lectures, not because they are necessarily very useful for completing the HW assignments, but because they are genuinely quite interesting. Dr. Compton is clearly passionate about CS, and she showed us a lot of cool applications that I did not think were approachable without a ton of experience.</td>

That said, this course may be challenging/ frustrating if this is your first time learning or coding seriously. The course is somewhat disorganized, and while Prof Compton teaches basic coding concepts, there aren’t many coding demonstrations. Thus, I think this course is difficult if you’ve never had to think in a “coding mindset” before.</td>

Only grades are weekly coding assignments and group activities (which should be a free 100 if you show up to class or if you just do the work remotely with your group) – you only really need to show up to class on the group assignment days (she has Zoom lives for each class anyways). I'd say the class is relatively easy, especially for someone who has limited experience in working with Python. However, I feel like her assignments were organized poorly – the tasks were always numbered weirdly or incorrectly, and a lot of the tests needed to check your code were missing or just wrong. I feel like her instructions for the assignment could definitely be better.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_d5c412aa-f45a-4df7-a47d-39a66b683a1d">I'm confused on what the ultimate purpose of this class was. For a class about fundamentals, it didn't actually teach students any fundamentals. The weekly projects covered random topics such as machine learning, to computer vision, to markov chains, none of which were actually explained to the depth needed to truly understand them. Furthermore, students often had to implement various libraries and such to work on the projects, as well as work off a template of pre–existing code. While it is important to know how to program in an existing codebase, I don't think that is a critical skill to learn during the early stages of coding. It would have been far more helpful to build projects from scratch. If an assignment needs instructions detailing nearly every line of code, that means that even the professor doesn't expect the students to fully understand the concepts; only to know how to implement individual steps after being told exactly what to do.</td>

My python knowledge from high school consisted of just drawing pictures, so being able to learn about python some more and how it can be applied to real world scenarios was pretty exciting. This is the only computer science class I intend to take, but this class has pushed me to learn about python and other languages on my own.</td>

It's very easy, but you won't learn any python. Compton is very nice, and clearly very intelligent, but to call her a teacher would simply be dishonest. Every lecture was just her talking about her career or some irrelevant use of programming. It seems like she spent more time finding gifs on reddit to put in her slides than trying to write problem sets or instructions that were vaguely useful. Again, Compton was nice, and in person she could be helpful, but as someone who was really excited for this class, it was super frustrating to not be taught a single thing. The furthest she would go with teaching syntax would be linking a semi–useful article in the instructions, which were often clearly not proofread, and nearly impossible to follow.</td>

The professor mostly discussed aspects of the tech industry as opposed to teaching the techniques of python. You will mostly figure out the assignments through google or office hours.

I find this disappointing considering the price we pay at this school. I have never had a more incomptent professor. Assignments consisted of directions with sentences not proof read: for example: "in this task you wil.." *never completes the sentence* dates are wrong, everywhere. I have never had a worse professor at NU. So incredibly disorganized. Horrible lecturer. You are better off coding on your own. Even the peer mentors and TAs clearly could not understand her disorganized assignments. Lines and lines of incorrect tasks and asserts. WORST. PROFESSOR. EVER.

Or, if there is an algorithm, the comments provided basically tell you step by step what to do. So while the homeworks implement interesting topics like machine learning, you don't actually learn how to implement machine learning, just how to follow some comment instructions to type some code. <br><br>Also, lectures that could be spent learning code are spent talking about programming ideas and stories from the professors life. While this could be useful, it should be in a computer science topics or theory class not in a intro to programming class which should be focused on learning how to code.<br><br>If you're going to continue in the CS sequence this seems like a waste of time.

The topic changed every week which normally wouldn't be a bad thing (it's good to learn about many different applications of coding), but the way Professor Compton taught made it alright at best and extremely irritating at worst. For most of the assignments, she had to send out "upddates" to the code because it was written wrong or needed more tests, and we were just expected to implement them on our own. Many of the topics covered in the assignments were not addressed at all during classes and you were just expected to know what to do. Even though this is supposed to be a beginner friendly course, it did not feel like one. If you want an A (or even a B) and you don't already have years of coding experience, you WILL NEED TO ATTEND OFFICE HOURS.

PMs vary in their ability to teach, and you'll have to go to a few to see which ones are good.

There was a group activity in class every Monday, so nobody went to class on Wednesday or Friday. I took this as a 5th class, and I showed up once a week. You don't need to go to the other lectures, because Compton's lectures have nothing to do with the homeworks. Sure, she would talk about data analysis for a full hour, but that has nothing to do with opening a json file with python. In the homeworks, theres a bunch of commented–out code that tells you what you should code, but Compton just gives links to websites explaining stuff instead of doing it herself in lecture. So basically CS 150 is a busy–work class that forces you to read about and learn python on your own. It is effective at that, though.</td>

She would talk in an abstract sense about computer science stuff, but would rarely ever teach anything. Her strategy seemed to be to just have every. This made the assignments a lot more difficult than they needed to be since her lectures covered nothing we needed to do to do the assignments. This class is required if you want a CS major or minor or want to take 211 or 214, so there's not really much choice in whether to take this class or not.

Even with programming experience, it is interesting to learn python. I thought that the labs (homeworks) were actually pretty fun. Additionally, although the lectures covered basic things, they were actually engaging. There are constant activities and problems to do in class.<br><br>I think that Prof. Kurdia was very smart in the way she approached this class. Her mentality of helping students build independence in programming language learning was very wise, and I think that it will help many students in the future, even if they don't realize it now. I felt like my feedback was heard in this class. Prof. Kurdia sent out a mid quarter survey in which students stated that they wanted more in class activities, which we certainly received.<br><br>I think my only issue with this class is that it felt a bit disorganized, however, this was Prof. Kurdia's first time teaching it so I think this was understandable.</td>

I feel like there were some unnecessary elements of the course like the discovery activities and the some of the labs, as it did not really help me much in terms of learning the material. I would have much rather preferred a lecture of those topics in class rather than having to figure it out on my own during a discovery activity.</td>

Often the instructions for the labs were not clear, meaning to understand what you are supposed to do, you would have to scroll through the EdStem posts of students asking questions to get the clarifications. Furthermore, some of the class was not accessible since you would need to download huge files to do a single assignment. Also, she would have assignments due 8 hours after they opened, which is hard if you work a job or have a busy day on the day it happens to be published. Her teaching style is fine, but the way assignments worked was so unstructured and confusing that it was hard to enjoy the class.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_5f959f50-0498-4a97-bb94-0f3dadbcfe84">This course was extremely challenging as someone with no prior Python experience. Professor Kurdia completely made me lose any interest in computer programming and did not provide any resources for us to become better programmers. The labs were poorly made and contained many issues that were completely unrelated to the code itself, resulting in hours and hours of extra unnecessary work. There were no practice exams for the midterms or final.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_5f959f50-0498-4a97-bb94-0f3dadbcfe84">The course itself was not that useful. We focused a lot on the very basics of programming which I guess is the point of the  course but when we did get to the more difficult topics like starting to use python libraries or just anything beyond the basics of programming, we skimmed over it. We were also never taught for these topics, we were given a "discovery" basically a packet with directions and told us to basically figure it out ourselves. Although I am a more hands–on learner, a bit more guidance in the lecture along with the hands–on activity would be more beneficial. The professor would over explain the basic concepts but not explain the topics that were a bit more confusing. The lectures itself felt a bit more unorganized. The part I enjoyed the most in this course were the labs, the homework. They were relatively engaging and at the perfect level of challenge, other than the last one as the near the end of the quarter the course kind of started to fall apart, things weren't getting graded and the direction for the last lab was extremely confusing that required you to start learning a new language. Since it was near the end and I've done well on all the other labs, I decided to drop this lab. Grading is relatively lenient. The professor is new, and you can tell she is new, she definitely has a lot to tweak in her lectures and course. In the end, I did not get much out of this course besides teaching me the syntax of python. If you have any coding background, a lot of the course will be tedious and repeating of what you already know. At the same time, I did not seek out and use all of the resources provided in this course as it was just not important to me. There are probably other students who got a lot more out of this course than I did. The lectures and course material can still taking some improvement.</td>

The lectures themselves were never insightful, the labs were hard because of lack of communication about what was asked of us, and the in–class activities weren't very hands on.  The class also never focused on trying to help us grow as programmers, instead teaching extremely basic concepts that we already covered last quarter but even more dumbed down, and then the labs were suddenly 10x harder than anything taught in class. Admittedly, the labs were the only thing making the class somewhat decent because they had realistic challenges, but they were often confusing because the auto grader was always extremely specific with what it wanted. TA's were very smart and helpful, and the teacher answered my questions very well one–on–one, but didn't bring that same energy to lectures.</td>

Unfortunately, Professor Kurdia did not seem to be interested in teaching. For example, she did not encourage question–asking in class. She informed students to never email her, and emails were rarely answered, unlike every other Northwestern professor I've had.<br>She also told the class to use ChatGPT to learn computer science. I was hoping to learn from a human versus OpenAI. Furthermore, assignments were rarely graded in a timely manner, and regrade requests would often go unanswered for numerous weeks. We also never received feedback on our code. We would have liked to get some kind of feedback on our code rather than the autograder simply marking it "correct" or "incorrect". On multiple assignments, Professor Kurdia gave us baseline code which we were supposed to use later on. However, sometimes, the baseline code was inaccurate, and we would realize that only after spending multiple hours to leverage it. We would have to go to the PMs who would point out that Professor Kurdia has given us wrong code or pasted the wrong prompt. This took up a lot of productive time. <br>Lastly, the week before finals, Professor Kurdia gave a speech about how important CTEC reviews are for her. I'm hoping she focuses on the students' learning, as that would translate to more positive feedback versus her mentioning how it will have an impact on her promotion.<br>One thing I appreciate is that she shows up to class on time.<br>To the student: if you take this course, be prepared to self–study or have friends who know how to code in Python.</td>

Make sure you leave extra time for the labs though (6 total) because they can be frustrating when you get stuck and don't know what to do. You basically just have to go to office hours to work through every lab if you want to do well, but the PMs are amazing and super helpful. I think this is just because we had a new professor but we had 3 quizzes (1 gets dropped) that make up 40% of your grade. I found this really annoying because there wasn't much to study and studying the content doesn't help you get better or learn to code better.

Professor Kurdia struggled to keep control the class and very little learning went on. Classes were filled with "Discovery Activities" which were just busy–work activities that took up significant time outside of class to complete. Rather than actually learning programing concepts, I spent copious amounts of time trying to install obscure software that we used maybe once.  There were weekly homework labs which were good for learning, however they were graded with an "Auto–Grader" which gave 0 credit on answers that deviated in any way from the correct answer. Your code could work perfectly and you could obtain the correct output, but if you had a different format, the question was marked as incorrect. It was demoralizing to receive a 0% on an assignment I spent hours on, simply because I was missing something trivial like an extra space. In conclusion, this class was ill–prepared and I often felt like I paid the price for this.</td>

Assignments sometimes had unclear instructions and it felt weird to often try and learn from third–party tutorials instead of official class slides/lecture notes/handouts etc., but I got to learn everything well and I think a lot of (anticipated) criticisms are undeserved. The professor was/is always positive and genuinely wants you to succeed, and getting good scores on quizzes/assignments was always manageable.

You still need to put in the work. The Professor is not very good at keeping the class engaged because she teaches very slow and it's difficult to pick up the important things in between the unimportant ones. The course is NOT structured well and expectations for grading as well as understanding what grade you have is not clear. You have one lab a week and if you aren't a programmer, it will take you around 6 hours but you do get to work with a partner. There are three quizzes and you get to drop one. The first one is easy, but don't let that fool you. Quizzes are 40%, Labs are 40%, Practice is 10%, and Participation is 10%. SHOW UP TO CLASS EVERY CLASS. You might not be learning that much, but you never know when you are going to an in class assignment that counts as participation/practice and it's not very clear what is for points or not, or what is just for completion versus accuracy. I don't recommend taking this class unless you are taking it for a major/minor requirement or are very good at coding.</td>

I did not like the structure of exams in this class.

This assignment concerned a new topic that was talked about or covered in class at all previously. The idea behind it was to challenge your brain; however, I believe it was unsuccessful because people just spent the entire class being confused or looking up the answers. I think that perhaps a flipped classroom that day would have beneficial. For example, if we watched a lecture at home about the topic, and then came in during class and did the assignment. Another issue was that Kurdia only liked to be addressed through Ed, and this made personal communication with her very difficult. Her slides were boring and she lacked the energy required to captivate a large room. Many of labs needed to be regraded because points were recklessly taken off.  Additionally the homework was released on Friday, but then due on Wednesday not giving adequate amount of time to be completed. The homework often had unclear instructions and sometimes tests were not provided and there was no autograder.

Every Monday, there is a discovery activity where you go through an exercise either by yourself or in a group  which helps you learn certain concepts and essentially explore certain concepts. In theory this sounds like a nice idea, but the activity was due in a day and everyone was in a rush to complete it as soon as possible, so didn't really soak in the information of this exercise. Besides this there are a lot of activities in class that are not that interesting and don't do a great job of   helping understand the concepts as they are held on a separate software intended for aiding the learning process which leads to more focus on figuring out the software, website rather than understanding the topics.<br><br>A large problem with the class is definitely the teacher. Professor Kurdia seems like a nice lady and did answer a lot of the students' questions, but her lectures were extremely boring. She has a very soft voice and in a large lecture hall could not really command the class nor get the students to pay attention that much. There weren't that many activities where she  engaged with the students in the class. If she had more energy and enthusiasm, this may have helped people pay attention a bit more. Most times it feels like Professor Kurdia is just talking and people are hearing without really listening. I came into this class having a pretty good understanding of Python, but I expected to learn a lot in terms of problem solving and design patterns and I was disappointed that this class didn't teach any of that. This is in contrast to CS111 where I learnt a lot about how to think like a programmer even though it was taught in Racket.<br><br>The only redeeming part of this course was the labs which I felt were quite interesting and challenging. They forced you to think a bit more and taught a lot about writing tests, documenting code by writing comments and doc strings, and writing more clean code by effective use of functions and constants. However, I felt that for someone who doesn't know Python, the lectures are not effective enough in laying the foundation for the labs leading to you having to self–learn a lot of things.</td>

I would say that the structure of the class is pretty good too since a lot of the class times tend to be you and a group (or yourself) working on a worksheet and/or practice activity to help learn some basic functionalities of Python and also coding in general. Besides practice activities there are also standard lectures which can be a little dry but they mostly serve to just introduce the concepts and then you practice them on your own. For homeworks there are 6 of them and you can drop the lowest grade which is nice (same for the Quizzes/Exams). The exams themselves are very fair and are simple enough I believe.

If you put in the work to do the labs and go to class, you're essentially guaranteed an A. However, and I'll cut her some slack because it's her first year, Professor Kurdia is not very good at teaching. Her lectures are boring and seem to go on forever. When I look at other people's computers in class, no one is paying any attention to her because it is just so difficult to.  Also, when we had in–class activities, we would have to completely learn the new topic on our own, and in the next class, she would then teach it. This once again made class so boring because we were relearning something that should've been taught before the in–class activity. I had a bit of experience with Python beforehand, but if I hadn't, I think the in–class activities would've been near impossible. Luckily they were only graded on completion, so that was a good thing on her part. Professor Kurdia also seemed pretty unprepared. Every assignment or quiz had at least 1–2 vague questions or things that just led to unnecessary confusion. It was also impossible to communicate with her outside of class. She told us not to email her but to reach out to her on edstem if we had any questions, which is a totally fair thing to ask. However, I reached out to her four times on edstem and never got a response. If you didn't talk to her within the 5 minutes she was there after class ended (and there was always a really long line to talk to her), your question wouldn't get answered. The TAs responded quickly, though.  Another thing she did was treat us like we were in high school. Her mic was always really quiet, so when she began class no one really noticed and continued talking. When this happened, she would either stand in silence and stare at everyone or she would turn the lights on and off. And this wouldn't really do anything because everyone would just be confused about what's going on. I truly hope she grows as a professor and does better, but it really wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if you took this class with her because it is easy.</td>

She seemed disorganized and learning was mostly expected to take place outside of class/individually through discovery assignments that were never gone over. This ultimately meant we'd be set out to learn a concept all on our own, but never have clarification to see if what we learned was actually right. It just was not an effective model. I don't think going to lecture was useful at all to me, although it was mandatory. The last lab assignment was also pretty crazy – she expected that we learn a new programming language (not python) the week before reading week. Wanted us to do a project in that language and write a paper about the experience. It just wasn't a good use of time and was a pretty crazy ask. Resources are pretty good though, edstem is helpful if you have an issue completing a lab. Lots of office hours and opportunity to get help.

I would have appreciated it if we knew how many labs we had in the quarter and just how the auto–grader policy worked so I wouldn't be docked points. I honestly came out of lectures more confused than when I went in because she kind of just rambles very quietly in the lecture hall and writes some things down in chalk sometimes.  It also kind of seemed like she didn't know what she was doing when doing coding in lectures and it was not a reassuring sight. Doing labs helps you learn a lot!

There are also discovery activities (worth 10%) graded for completion every Monday that you get to complete with a group.  Attendance is also graded (10%). There are 3 quizzes (worth 40%) that are all on Canvas and completed in class. They are mostly multiple choice and a few free responses where you have to write code.

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_5f959f50-0498-4a97-bb94-0f3dadbcfe84">I have a lot of mixed feelings about this course. Coming in as someone with some Python and general CS experience (CS 110/111 alongside data science courses), this course was not particularly difficult to grasp conceptually,  but the labs and in–class "Discovery" activities still took unnecessarily long to do. The discovery activities were POGIL worksheets in the form of editable PDFs that were meant to be done collaboratively. However, I think that "collaboration" was counterproductive. In the time we had, it was difficult to make the idealistic case of everyone working together simultaneously and ensuring each others' complete understanding to ever happen for groups beyond just 2 people. It doesn't help that I also found the discovery activities unhelpful content–wise because rather than hands–on experience with coding, it was more so copying code to see what is outputted. If anything, actually coding things would be more helpful than trying to approach it conceptually by answering numerous specific questions like "How many attributes does this class have?" to teach you where to find such info. Compared to my experience with CS 110/111 with tutorials, there is a lot to be desired with those in–class activities, but at least they were completion–based. We never got answer keys, though (and if we did, I cannot easily find it).<br><br>The slides were also lackluster. They contained info, but they weren't compiled very clearly, and I found it unnecessarily difficult to find certain topics at times. Those basic topics we were asked about in the discovery activities would've been easier and less tedious to learn if there were slides that clearly labeled everything in a general way. On top of that, there were multiple instances where there was something in the labs that I could not find info about through the slides (or even the discovery activities). Speaking of the labs, they were also very annoying to do. Some were borrowed from the CS 150 professor in past years, and that professor was also known for being subpar. The instructions were confusing at times, and the number of questions asked every week on edSTEM about things that should be made clear is concerning. There was a lab where one TA had to post clarifying notes for every task in that lab with how many people were having trouble. I don't know if it's some strange attempt at making us comfortable self–teaching and working with messy code or comments, but regardless, it's upsetting that we are expected to learn the actual concepts well with that. Trying to teach self–teaching skills would've been better done with assignments or projects that include some creative liberty and just have a list of code requirements that you need to implement. The labs are graded on performance rather than completion, but the two lowest grades were dropped (including 0s, so you could skip some). The late penalty was unclear, which was frustrating. <br><br>The boundaries between different topics were somewhat unclear, but that could just be because the lectures were very dry. With the room we were in (Tech LR2) and how Professor Kurdia does not have a very clear voice, it was difficult to hear her at times. As a person, Professor Kurdia is great, and she tries her best to answer questions directly. But as a lecturer, it was hard to stay interested, especially with how slow/inefficient the lectures sometimes felt. That could be because I have experience in Python, though. Attendance was graded through PollEverywhere, but there was no explicitly stated pattern for when we did certain activities in class (like when we will have a discovery activity, when we will have PollEv activities, etc). The syllabus lacked much useful info beyond the grading scale (which was unusual in that, for example, 94–100 was an A, but all non–integer grades are rounded up, making the actual range 93.01–100), and the number of grades we can drop per category.  At the beginning of the quarter, there was also a lot of confusion about which Python environments we were supposed to use (Visual Studio, IDLE, Spyder, etc.), which could have been easily avoided if there was one particular environment we were all recommended to use with the installation instructions given. <br><br>The only somewhat positive aspect of the course I see is how there are 3 quizzes and the lowest grade is dropped, making it 2 quizzes you need to take. If you are happy with your scores on the first 2 quizzes (the medians were 21 to 22 out of 25), you could skip the last quiz, which was scheduled during the final exam time. The quizzes were not too difficult (mostly MC with a few coding questions, and no cheatsheets/resources provided during quizzes), but we never received practice quizzes, which I think could have been very helpful.<br><br>There were more examples of things that contributed to my dislike of this course in addition to everything I have mentioned. I don't recommend taking this class if you don't have to. I went into it thinking it would be fairly relaxed, but even though the content wasn't difficult for me, it ended up unnecessarily stressful. If you are still fairly new to Python, this class might actually be quite demanding. I don't have high hopes of this course improving with how it seems to have been consistently mediocre before, but it would be great if Professor Kurdia could properly revamp and improve this course after the past professor.</td>

Professor Kurdia structured the course in a excellent manner despite it being her first time teaching the course at Northwestern.

My advice for students who plan to take this course, regardless of whether its with Kurdia or not, is to start early on lab (code) assignments and to go to office hours as much as you can. The PM's (Peer Mentors) are more than happy to help you and even if you have a simple or "dumb" question (no such thing btw), asking that question rather than keeping it to yourself will help solidify your knowledge of the content.</td>

However, this course is not the place to learn it. If you have any programming experience, it would be far easier and much less infuriating than going through this course. Most intro CS courses use an auto–grader to grade assignments, and the good ones will let you resubmit your homework in order to make sure the auto–grader doesn't flag your code for minor discrepancies. This course did exactly that, it let you resubmit your homework to make sure you got the code right and didn't have any formatting errors. Or at least it did until about week 2 when the prof turned off the tests on the autograder until after the due date. This means that it was often times a crap shoot when deciphering what the homework wanted you to do. (No it didn't help that most of the questions were written extremely poorly, and most of the data analysis homeworks were the definition of tedious). But my issues with the class don't end there. Most college students can put up with bad homework assignments, but a greater crime is that the lectures for this class were incredibly boring.

The actual content of the lectures was elementary and repetitive, but still only scratched the surface on what they expect from you on the homework assignments and quizzes.</td>

Personally, I'd come into the course after taking both 110 and 111, and I'd recommend the same unless you're an experienced programer. The course moves extremely quickly, and I would've been lost without prior knowledge of the content. It flies through learning Python, and towards the end of the course flies through ideas of recursion and object oriented programing. Lectures, while required, were dull and difficult to pay attention to. The expectations for assignments (what to turn in, what was due, details for projects) were particularly unclear. Many times assignments were not announced, and there was no consistent schedule for due dates for participation assignments or projects. Exams were the most stressful, as we were never really told what to study except to "achieve mastery" of all content.</td>

While I understand that our professor believes "the more I do the less you learn," the entire purpose of this course is for us to be taught Python, not for us to learn it on our own just as we would using any online Python course. Everything has been a difficulty since I, along with many other students in this class, am not familiar with the Python syntax/functions. This class assumes that everyone knows what they're doing from the beginning, which just makes everything that much more difficult for students learning Python for the first time. CS111, the class' pre–requisite, does not teach python.</td>

It was hard to hear her during lectures, and I found myself learning the material through Youtube videos and documentation. <br><br>The labs were posted late and the slides were posted days later, meaning I had to resort to online sources days before accessing the lecture notes. There was little to no responses on EdStem and had to ask her in class, to which she would dodge questions and give vague answers. For example, when quizzes were coming up, students would ask questions such as "How should we study for the quiz?," and she would respond by asking other people how they studied and using that as her answer. There were also no practice quizzes and you can't use pen and paper (opposite from CS111). Also, in my experience, office hours were not helpful; there were TA's who would look at my code and say "Hmmm... it looks right." <br><br>Another thing was Prof Kurdia's changing her mind of Lab regrades on the last day of class, impacting everyone's grade. The auto–grader is VERY specific and involves trial and error in order to get an 100 before the lab closes, however, Prof Kurdia decided to stop showing our score after the auto–grader leaving students to have to wait for their score. Prof Kurdia changed the auto–grader but added a lab re–grader to show we learned from our mistakes, However, in our last class, Prof Kurdia decided to remove it, lowering everyone's grade. I think the concept of a Prof changing their mind on things that will impact our grade should not be happening. These choices should be made and final before the quarter starts, leaving no confusion to the students.<br><br>Definitely learn Python on your own before coming into the class. There was little to no help and you have to rely heavily on your peers with experience and YouTube videos.</td>

You will learn most of the course on your own during homework assignments. They do not grade assignments until the end of the quarter. Very disorganized class and labs often have many issues that are only sorted out once it is assigned. This course needs to be designed by Prof. Bain, who knows how to teach an intro CS course.

She does not write any of her assignments, and thus struggles with the grading of it consequently.

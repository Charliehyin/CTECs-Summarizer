It is really nothing complicated or hard. The course load is not heavy at all. However, I think it's important to not slack off or not pay attention just because it seems easy. Because the fundamentals taught in this class are still very important. The weekly assignments are very interesting and taught many useful practices.</td>

Course switched to C++ for the last couple of weeks to prepare for upper level CS courses, but I think it would have been better to choose either python or C++ since it creates a discontinuity in the information. Flipped class model – you teach yourself. Work is as follows: Video lectures (10–60min), lecture quizzes (5min), lecture assignments (30–40min), and weekly assignments (depends on who you are – I spent maybe 2 hours a week).</td>

I had anticipated to have a thorough understanding of python upon completion but that was not the case. This is because students took a passive role in the assignments. The assignments were to complicated for a beginner in programming, so the professor would write most of the code leaving only small portions for the student. I feel a better approach would be using less complicated assignments to teach concept by concept so that by the end a beginner will have learned something and not merely completed the coursework. Lectures should be organized around specific topics. The instructors was all over the place, covering random topics each week. Very disturbing for someone who didn't have coding experience and wanted to learn step by step.</td>

I took CS 111 in the fall and this was my last CS class because I was only taking some CS courses to help me out with my computational biology research. The best part of the course was how straightforward it was. The modules and quizzes were all published at the start with their respective deadlines, there would be one challenge with each concept to test your understanding (with an answer key if you get stuck), and one assignment every week. The assignments are the bulk of the course, but even those took me no longer than 1–2 hours every week because each assignment had an overview video that walked you through the code and logic for the assignment, so as long as you had watched the module videos and assignment walkthroughs, the assignments were super straightforward. Additionally, class this quarter was just office hours, so that made it really easy to get the assignments done because it was dedicated time to work on the assignment with help if anything came up that you didn't understand. Also, it teaches you Python so it was relevant and motivated me to learn the course content even more.</td>

I think Python is a very intuitive language, so learning it doesn't take much time at all. If you didn't like Racket in CS 111, you'll probably be glad to know that Python is much more straightforward.<br>My main complaint is that it was kind of tough to feel connected with the rest of the class because there wasn’t much point in going to lectures. Everything was formatted so it could be done asynchronously, which was nice in that it allowed for more flexibility, but it also made the class feel a little isolating sometimes. We also switched to C++ halfway through the quarter, and while it isn’t a particularly hard language to learn, we spent almost no time introducing it before we had to start doing C++ assignments, so that was a really jarring transition for me.<br>However, I think these issues would probably be a lot better if we were in person and overall, I still think this is a great intro class –– you really do learn a lot if you put in the effort and the work is very manageable.

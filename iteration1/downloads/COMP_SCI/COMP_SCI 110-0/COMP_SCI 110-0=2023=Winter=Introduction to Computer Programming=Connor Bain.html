It begins deceptively simple, but quickly gains a thicker layer of complexity as the quarter goes on. I struggled initially because I didn't allocate enough time to work through and completely understand the homework and other assignments, but even with this and taking orgo as a premed, I was able to get an A without too much trouble. My biggest piece of advice is to stay on top of the course flow. Even as an introductory class, it moves quickly and covers a lot of content. Assignments are decently cumulative as well, so don't fall behind. As for a specific learning tactic, I would work through most, if not all, of the practice problems the prof. introduces in the lectures. This is especially helpful for the quizzes, which are very representative of what you learn in class. So make sure you learn. <br><br>The class is broken down as follows: projects (x2), homework (x6, can drop 1), quizzes (x3, can drop 1), in class "tutorials" (x7, can drop 1), and in class "mini–quizzes" (x6, canNOT drop any). Tutorials are just shorter homework assignments that you have the opportunity to do in class or remotely, and mini–quizzes are simply graded–for–participation in–class quizzes. As you can see, there's a lot, but it's only overwhelming if you fall behind on learning the content. <br><br><br>As for the teacher, prof. Bain is great. He's very upbeat and passionate to teach, and always willing to give effective advice –  but not the hand–held kind that explains everything to you. We use a platform called Campuswire to ask him and the TAs questions (just Piazza with a better UI) and he's usually pretty quick to reply. <br><br>In all, I enjoyed this course and learned a lot. The best thing was that I came out of it with a sense of pride for my work (code I wrote for assignments), which is hard to find in STEM classes.</td>

You need to study for the quizzes and just try things in Python to prepare. The projects will take you on an emotional rollercoaster and can be very stressful at times but you have so much relief when you finally finish. Thankfully, there's OH all day everyday so use them!! Some of the PMs are really helpful and others not so much, but once you go to enough OH you'll figure out which ones are good. Having a good partner(s) when doing the final project is really good and it can be really good to have someone to celebrate with when your code finally works!</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_0d8d91f2-41b1-4271-97d0-61e687e77dd8">This was a really good class if you've never taken Python. I know some of the other professors who teach CS 110 give much less graded assignments and less work, but I found I actually learned and the homework was super manageable since it was just watching a prerecorded lecture once a week and doing a longer homework once a week. Connor was super responsive on campuswire and an engaging lecturer you can tell he really does care.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_0d8d91f2-41b1-4271-97d0-61e687e77dd8">This class was WAY too hard to be called "Intro" to Computer Programming. I found that none of the materials in the lectures actually helped in any of the in–class activities, which my groupmates and I struggled to complete every class, nor the homeworks, which were way too hard and graded for accuracy. The good thing is the class was really manageable to get an ok grade in as long as you attended class, completed the projects, and studied for the exams (because thankfully the exams actually contained questions from the lectures and practice quizzes). Overall, not an easy distro; if you decide to take this class and aren't the most STEM inclined (like me), be prepared to obtain information FAST and remember it all, utilize office hours at least a couple times a week, and spend a lot of time working on the homeworks and projects, more time than theoretically you should be spending. An intro class should not have been this difficult!</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_0d8d91f2-41b1-4271-97d0-61e687e77dd8">Mister Doctor Professor Connor Bain was a great instructor. Attendance at the scheduled class time isn't mandatory, but it is heavily encouraged and motivated (e.g., assignments graded for completion vs accuracy). His lectures break down the concepts well, and his examples/demonstrations in Python itself help to really understand what you're accomplishing when you're typing code. I didn't find the class super difficult, but there are plenty of resources available for when anyone does need help or clarification (CampusWire, office hours, etc).</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_0d8d91f2-41b1-4271-97d0-61e687e77dd8">While I learned quite a bit as someone who was new to coding, I felt that the course was a lot. While the grading policy was extremely fair, the subject matter began to move way too fast towards the second half. Plus, the course is structured in such a way that the more difficult concepts are taught through recorded lectures, which is confusing and much less accessible. I'd also say that you should prepare to spend a TON of time in office hours. I would make this the hardest course of the quarter –– and plan to spend hours a week in office hours / review sessions. The course is also set up in a way that you aren't allowed to leave early to attend another course right after, which I found incredibly stressful.</td>

If you, like me, had no experience with coding before this course, your attention to the lectures and material will allow you to do well. That is, for the first four or five weeks...<br>– Homework assignments are due on Mondays before class, and you get about a week to do them. Definitely ample time.<br>– If you find a good PM, they will save your life and be so helpful and thoroughly explain the content so you know how to apply it. Some PMs and TAs are amazing.<br><br>Cons:<br>–CONnor<br>– Things go haywire after the first four weeks, and you will notice the shift in lectures, assignments, etc. This is partially because of the quarter system's structure, but lectures start to feel like a coloring book: you're given the outline, but not only do you have to buy colored pencils, but you have to fill the lines in on your own. Mind you, it is absolutely NOT a color–by–number book.<br>– If you have no experience with coding, this will NOT be an Easy A. You HAVE to go to Office Hours––much emphasis on the plural. You have to go to multiple sessions multiple times a day. This is a HUGE time commitment!!!!!! The only reason I finished with an A is because I took 3 classes this quarter. I can't imagine taking this along with 3+ other classes. I am a non–major, and this class was designed for non–majors, so I think it's fair for me to be frustrated with this.<br>– Office Hours can be useless. The PMs do not have a great approach to helping students. If you want the help you need from most of them, you must be one of the loudest in the room or grab them by the arm. I'm not joking, either. I've seen multiple people do this and be helped ahead of those waiting for forty minutes. It's happened to me, too. I sat there with my hand raised for an entire Office Hour session and was told twice by the PM: "I'll help you next." Then, of course, someone else would practically pull the PM into their lap to look at their code and take time away from the rest of us. All in all, if you have a good PM, they will tell the others to wait and go in order. <br>– Connor might be a nice guy, but he can be pretty passive–aggressive at times, and it's hard for us who have no Computer Science experience and are essentially learning a new language. <br>– Mini–quizzes and lectures are NOTHING like the homework or quizzes, hence why although I never missed a class I had to be in Office Hours multiple times a day and study day in and day out. The homework and quizzes are Kool–Aid, and the mini–quizzes and lectures are water––not even watered–down Kool–Aid––they are WATER with, if you're lucky, a hint of fruit punch. The examples in class need to be more complex because that's what the homework is like.<br>– PMs cancel their Office Hours CONSTANTLY. I understand they have other responsibilities and things come up, but they signed up for this too. Cancellations happen too frequently and you are left to your own devices, especially when they don't cancel until the night before you planned on going to get help. Sometimes, they don't even update the Google Sheet and you, with a bunch of other kids who have no idea what to do, sit in a PM–less room for an hour, and you leave with the same TypeError you had when you walked in. <br><br>Overall rating of the class: 3.5/10</td>

As a non–stem student, it was very hard to follow along because of the fast pace of the course. The PA's were all sweethearts, and the alternative tutorial times are so important if you also find the jump from lecture to tutorials very challenging like I did. The homework was also WAY harder than the lectures and mini–quizzes but are very similar to tutorials.

It's hard to be engaged with a lecture at 10am but he includes active participation in all of his lectures which seems to be far and in between at Northwestern. The structure of the class is set up pretty well, although I would recommend skimming the lecture slides for Monday the night before and taking notes/ jotting down questions, then just following along with examples in class. For Wednesdays tutorial sessions, I would recommend watching it as soon as possible after Monday's lecture, which helped me not forget to do it. These are crucial for getting the tutorials done, otherwise you'll just be lost. Definitely suggest going to the in person tutorial sessions rather than doing them on your own because you can work through them with others and they're not graded for accuracy (you fill out a form). Often, the work done in the tutorial session  can be applied to the homework for the week which is another reason to attend in person. There are 3 quizzes, which are not that hard if you are keeping on top of the vocabulary and actually attend lecture. The 2 projects are not that bad, they're really just a more applied version of the homework. I would suggest not waiting until the last minute to start them though because they can be a lot to get done in one day.</td>

I found myself at office hours for almost every assignment and the projects were horrible, too. The first half of the class requires around 1 hour of effort per week if you manage to complete the homework at an OH session. Around week 5, we start working on projects which takes up much more time and are basically just nonstop OH until the assignment is completed. I feel like the class would have been better if we just did Python practice problems similar to the practice quizzes. The first project was very unhelpful but I feel like the second one helped me understand the complexity of dictionaries.</td>

While some people did not like professor bain's teaching style, I personally learned a lot from him. There is not too much of a workload. You have to watch a lecture on your own once a week and there is one weekly homework due Mondays. However, this course is very participation heavy. There are tutorials on Wednesdays, which is basically where in class you complete an assignment that applies what we have learned so far that week. If you go to class, you automatically get a 100, but if you don't go you have to complete the tutorial on your own time and are graded based on how well you did. Same for the Friday mini quizzes. There are 3 exams and 2 projects. The last project and final exam are due/happen within a week of each other, which is annoying. However, they drop your lowest exam grade. So if you do well enough on your first 2 exams, you can choose to not take the final exam since your lowest grade is dropped anyway. Also, there are a lot of office hours, so if you have questions there is a high chance you can get them answered quickly.</td>

The grade is also calculated from many assessments (weekly homework, 2 major projects, 3 quizzes, weekly mini–quizzes, and weekly tutorials), so no one assessment holds too much weight and getting a good grade is very doable without doing out–of–class studying. Additionally, Professor Bain is an amazing professor and super helpful and personal for such a large class. The canvas for the class is also very comprehensive and makes all expectations and guidelines, and due dates very clear without going to class in–person. Would recommend if you have an interest in Python as a non–CS major!</td>

I'm not gonna lie, the ctecs made it sound easier than it was, which it wasn't for me. People did fine on average, but the homeworks took me a lot of time and the first few weeks of learning material and trying to apply it were really really rough for me. It takes a lot of getting used to practice in office hours. The projects are brutal, but the homeworks and tutorials help. Go to Angeli's tutorial sessions!! Even if you get the credit for the tutorial by going to class, she really helps explain the process and helps you through rough parts of the tutorial you might have struggled on, because they're hard. Overall, I've heard the other prof's class is much easier, but Bain is also great. Homework, tutorial, and mini–quizzes every week, three quizzes that are like midterms, and 2 projects. You get to drop one quiz, one homework, and one tutorial. An A is definitely achievable.</td>

This was really really nice, because it made an A extremely attainable, even as someone who didn't do that well on the two major quizzes.

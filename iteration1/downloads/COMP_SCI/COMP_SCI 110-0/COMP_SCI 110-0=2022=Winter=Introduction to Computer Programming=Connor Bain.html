Overall decent class. Not too difficult to get an A given that there is a total of 16 possible extra credit points for the semester given on projects. You also get to drop one midterm quiz. If you do good on the first two you do not have to take the final midterm. Start projects early, the deadline always comes quicker than expected.</td>

The bulk of the time I spent working outside of class was me scratching my head about how any of our assignments related to what we were talking about. If you have former comp sci experience, then this is a nice class.

You really only learn in tutorial sessions and office hours. OLIVIER WAS THE BEST TA. I was not in his session, but I went to his office hours and he was great. My TA, Cindy, was awful. She did not teach me a single thing and her zoom links were constantly not working. Her tutorial session was absolutely useless.

Not only did the lectures not prepare us for tutorials/homework, they were extremely difficult for an intro class. Also, I think that there are other ways of teaching intro to python that don't spend the majority of the course learning how to animate shapes and make "creatures" in Tkinter. It wasn't until the last couple of days did we finally start learning how to read files and stuff like that, which actually has more practical use than animating creatures.</td>

There are lots of resources available, along with a plethora of office hours to attend. That said, you get what you put in, and if you don't pay attention or ask for help, you're going to struggle. There's built in lee–way in the class so if you mess up on something, the lowest gets dropped (2 lowest tutorials out of 9, 1 lowest homework out of 6, 1 lowest test out of 3).</td>

I learned about many important fundamentals of coding and had a fun time doing such. The key to this class though is ASKING FOR HELP. If you do not understand something, do not waste your time trying to figure it out on your own out of pride. You will be much better off having a TA help you, and this will improve your class experience. Also the professor was amazing and you can really tell that he cares about students doing well in the class. The class is also so forgiving in that you can drop a homework, a quiz, and a couple tutorials. I don't know any other class this forgiving. If you ever get the chance, go to professor office hours and just have a conversation with him. If you are looking for a class to fulfill a distro or are just interested in coding but not sure you want to pursue a major/minor, this is a good course for you.</td>

However, this class is definitely for people with little to no experience. I will say that as long as you put in the work, such as doing every tutorial and homework assignment and the project you will definitely get an A in the class. The biggest thing is to go to the office hours to ask for help because I definitely would not have been able to go through this class without the office hours of the peer mentors.

I came into it with absolutely no programming experience whatsoever and had no idea what to expect, but I found it really interesting and enjoyable! It made me want to take more CS classes even though I don't need to for my major. I liked how straightforward it was, either your code works or it doesn't, so you pretty much always know if you're gonna get 100%. With the exception of the 3 quizzes (lowest gets dropped), there's really no reason to not get 100% on every assignment as long as you give yourself enough time to complete it and go to Office Hours if something isn't working right. Prof. Bain and the TAs and Peer Mentors are super helpful in Office Hours and will always be able to fix your errors if your code is messed up. Prof. Bain is one of my favorite instructors I've had at NU so far. He's funny and uses really fair and accommodating policies in his class. He lets you drop your lowest or 2 lowest scores for each type of assignment and will almost always grant extensions whenever you need them for any or no reason. Lectures are a good mix of notes and examples so they're not boring, and they're all recorded so you can always skip class and watch them later (I did this frequently for my 9am section lol). Anyway overall amazing class. I honestly think everyone should take it even if it has nothing to do with your major. It's super easy and honestly really enjoyable. Being able to figure out how to code something correctly when you've never coded anything before is just a really rewarding feeling, and it’s definitely a GPA booster even if you do the absolute bare minimum. They grade really easily and there are a lot of extra credit opportunities on the projects. I’m ending with above 100% and I had never coded before this class.</td>

If you're on the fence about CS and haven't done any programming before, you should definitely take this class. It's super chill and really eases you into working with Python. I really didn't know that much about coding before, but I didn't think this course was terribly difficult at all.</td>

Professor Bain is one of the kindest professors I've encountered. He makes a big effort to make everyone feel welcome and appreciated both in class and at office hours. He makes the content of lectures very clear and the homework assignments and projects are challenging enough to be interesting without feeling overwhelming. This course has made me want to pursue computer science further which is not something I thought I would say.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_8b20d1e7-898f-45a4-987e-0483902cf965">This course was a good distribution requirement. It was REALLY hard though, but luckily the professor is very understanding and gives a TON of extra credit. He is very lenient with the grading: He drops your lowest 2 tutorial assignments and your lowest homework and your lowest quiz. I will admit that this course is not easy though. I had to work so hard. We have class 3x a week and then you also have a weekly tutorial assignment and you also have a weekly homework assignment that requires you to teach yourself some material. If you are going to take this class, be sure to have a friend or acquaintance that you can meet up with to do the work together. Although I will finish with a decent grade (even though I received 2 Fs on the midterm quizzes... his extra credit rocks!), this course was exhausting at times. You must attend every single lecture if you want any chance of finishing with an A or B. Bain is a great professor though and has a lot of enthusiasm which makes the course worthwhile.</td>

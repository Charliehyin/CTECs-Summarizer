The biggest issue is that there is too much content and confusing assignments, especially towards the end of the course.  I ended up having a good grade, since they are thankfully very lenient in grading, so that is why my review of the course isn't too bad.  However, although your grade will most likely remain fine after this course, you will struggle a lot and want to cry sometimes.  I'm conflicted on how I feel about the course.  Would I recommend it?  Yes, since Prof Van Wart is a good starting teacher for this and you will most likely need computer programming skills in many jobs in the future.  However, if you really don't think you like comp sci, I wouldn't recommend taking this then.</td>

There's a ton of leniency built into the course which I appreciated, and Sarah + the TA team are super open and helpful for students and questions. DEFINITELY utilize office hours and go to tutorials if you are new to computer science. Overall, while I'm unsure if I'll continue doing cs after this, this was a good introduction and I learned a lot of useful skills, and the staff running this class are very helpful.</td>

Also, I felt like the only identity I saw represented in coding in my high school and in the world immediately around me was cis men. As someone who is not a cis man, that made me more nervous to take a coding class. Sarah was amazing. She was so approachable and knowledgable and friendly. Above all, Sarah is the best ~teacher~ I have ever had at Northwestern. The way she broke down coding concepts and made them building blocks to help understand the whole course was invaluable. TAs are also all a great resource, I would just go to whatever office hours fit into my schedule and all were easygoing and willing to help.</td>

Sarah was a great and very understanding professor; I would highly recommend taking this class with her. I had never taken computer science before this class, but it was pretty easy to pick up python. Sarah recorded lectures, which was really nice, but it did mean that most people never showed up to class. The quizzes were pretty easy, the tutorials were relatively short, and the projects were interesting, although a little time–consuming. The grading in the class is very lenient, as you can drop your lowest quiz grade, skip a homework, and drop two tutorials, and with extra credit on the projects, you have a lot of room to make up for poor grades on other assignments. I also really appreciated having peer mentors run the tutorials and office hours, as I attended many office hour sessions to get help with homework and projects. Would overall recommend this class to anyone.</td>

By nature of the material, there is quite a bit of material that you have to cover each week, especially in the middle of the course, but it's pretty manageable. Sarah is a great lecturer and instructor and is so knowledgeable about the course content. The thing that I really enjoyed about the class was the amount of resources and people that we available to help at all times during the week. There are multiple office hours slots each week, tutorial instructors, and an online forum to get help whenever. I think you really get out of the course what you put in. If you're really into the coding, there are plenty of opportunities to go above and beyond. But if this is just a distro, you can do the bare minimum and still get a good grade and learn some useful tools. Overall highly recommend; I think everyone is set up to succeed and get an A in this course based on the way it's designed.</td>

The CTECs were great and I've always been interested in coding. However, this class was really hard as someone who has no coding experience. Let me start here: Sarah, our professor, was so nice and provided so many opportunities to get help. There are like 15 peer helpers/TAs who all have office hours, so there are office hours for multiple hours every day of the week and they will all help you with your homework and projects. Grading is really fair as well (we are allowed to drop one quiz, one homework, and two tutorials). There are no finals/midterms (there are three quizzes) but there are two really long and difficult projects. The problem with the class is that it is a whole new language, and sometimes it was hard to go from what we learned in class to the homework/projects. Also, we do have to meet four times a week instead of the MWF that is advertised on the webstie. That is because we have a weekly tutorial that we have to sign up for at the beginning of the class. Overall, the class is VERY hard but doable if you are putting in a ton of work and taking advantage of the help available. Not an easy A at all though.</td>

That's definitely a plus to taking this course, but I did feel as though the lectures were much easier than the homework and project assignments. I felt like I had to teach myself a lot of things through the internet or by going to office hours while the lectures were spent completing pretty simple tasks and problems. I would be able to do the in–class lecture problems pretty easily but I would be stuck on the homework and tutorials for hours before reaching out to the TAs. I will say that the TAs and Sarah are easy to reach and ask for help, so that's a plus.</td>

Sarah cares a lot about her students and is very helpful and passionate about the subject area. She also builds leniency into the course and is very fair with grading. The weekly tutorial sessions were also helpful, if you had the right TA, and office hours were constantly held by TAs. The weeks where there was a tutorial and a homework due were slightly overwhelming, and the projects were definitely challenging, but there were plenty of opportunities for additional help and extra credit. The quizzes were also very fair and not too difficult. Some of the lectures were very interesting and engaging, others not as much, but it was nice that you never necessarily had to attend the lectures in person as they were always recorded and posted online. That being said, I found it helpful to actually attend the lectures to stay on top of the workload and material.

Sarah is super great and understanding – I never felt like I had a dumb question. It's definitely possible to get a good grade without going to class, but you have to do well on the projects and quizzes. I liked this class overall, but it's not very technical –– it's very intro level and you do a lot of drawing/programming with things you probably won't use in the future.</td>

Sarah makes the content super accessible to people with no clue what they're getting themselves into but still keeps the class engaging for people who might have a foundation in CS. That said if you've done any coding I would recommend just starting with CS 111.</td>

The class had a flipped structure, with pre–recorded lectures and optional in–class exercises. I actually had never been interested in CS and thought I wouldn't like it, but I actually really enjoyed learning Python with Sarah! It was cool to problem–solve, and the applications we learned—such as the animation project—allowed us to be fun and creative. Additionally, Sarah was extremely helpful, and so were all of the TAs and Peer Mentors.</td>

The projects are amazing and Sarah gives enough time for students to work on projects that are actually cool. Sarah is super flexible with the tutorials, homework, and quizzes. This course also just teaches students valuable skills in problem–solving and in just creating something that's someone's own work. I thoroughly enjoyed this course!</td>

CS 110 teaches how to use different functions of Python, but all of the assignments seem near pointless. Half the class seems to be based around making a fun animation using python, when in reality, python would never be used to make an animation. Moreso, the side program Tkinter is rarely used, so it was a little upsetting that the whole class required mastery of this particular program.</td>

The grading system is very generous– all homeworks are graded based on whether you gave it a solid effort, and you can drop your lowest of three quizzes.

It balances the fun aspects like animations with the more practical aspects like data analytics. Even though I had no prior knowledge I was able to keep up with the material because help both in–person and online was so readily available. It's also great that you can drop the lowest score of Quizzes/ Tutorials/ Homeworks so even if you have a rough start, it's very possible to bounce back. Prof Sarah is also incredibly sweet and helpful.</td>

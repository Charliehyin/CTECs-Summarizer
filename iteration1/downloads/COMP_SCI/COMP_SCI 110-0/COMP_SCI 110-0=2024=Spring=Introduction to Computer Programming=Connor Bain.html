It's definitely a good class if you have no experience in computer science at all or are looking for an easy distro. If you have any experience in programming at all and you are interested in learning more, I probably wouldn't recommend this class.

Professor Bain will give you plenty of materials to help with quizzes, projects, and homeworks but he will not spoon feed you answers. He will point you in the direction you should go and expects you to find the solution. The work was not over difficult but their was a fair amount to do. One homework every week, a tutorial which you got credit for just showing up, 3 quizzes(like exams), and a couple of projects. He lets you drop your lowest scores for the different categories. A class I fully recommend.</td>

I had to go to office hours and attend every class to understand what was going on. The projects were also quite a bit of work so make sure you spread them out over the time you get.

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_17ff4ba0-e089-4318-8f96-cdd032ff6d33">This was a pretty solid intro to comp sci class. I had no experience coding at all (except for in elementary school where we put together puzzle code blocks and made an orange cat move around lol), and I managed to do well. It's really easy to fall behind in the class, though, which can make it really stressful at times, especially before exams and before the projects. I think it's good to review the course content as you go through the class because everything builds up from what you learn at the start. If you put in the effort and go to office hours when you need help and stay on top of the work, it won't be that bad. Professor Bain is really friendly and willing to help, but he won't just tell you the answers, so you need to make sure you at least have questions to ask and things to talk about that you're confused on. I also think it's best to try the hardest for the first two exams because the 1 out of the 3 get dropped, so if you do well on the first two, it's honestly such a relief to be able to drop the last one (not even go) because that's normally during reading week and everyone's really stressed in all their other classes. I realized through this course that comp sci is not for me, but I still learned a lot and was able to make it through.</td>

I didn't know anything about python before this course but I often went to friday office hours which is basically him staying with people who need help right after class, and he was willing to help me with so many things. I liked the structure of the course though it does emphasize attendance, but I knew people who sort of fell behind when they missed one of the key homeworks, so make sure you stay on track and you'll succeed! CONNOR BAIN IS JUST SUCH AN ANGEL.</td>

At first, everything felt slow and understandable but by the last few weeks and the final project, it was much more important to go to office hours. However, the grading policies are good, there are plenty of office hours, and the auto grader helps so much because you can make changes and resubmit assignments until you get a 100.</td>

Unfortunately I was someone who did not. And so all of the work we were given felt very overwhelming and stressful. Its a very week–heavy workload with almost nothing during the weekend which is nice but again, makes the weeks overwhelming. It was also frustrating that the quizzes were weighted so heavily as someone who did not get it because it felt impossible to do well on the quizzes and it tanked my average a lot.

Mondays are optional (recorded) lectures, Wednesdays are required attendance for group practice projects and prep for the weekly homework, Fridays are mini quizzes where you get an automatic 100% if you go to class.

All missteps and confusions are accounted for, students are provided every file and folder needed to do the assignments, and all labeling on the assignments is extremely clear. Dr. Bain has designed a wonderful, nearly perfect class for students who want to learn about the concepts of CS, and he has done it all with a positive attitude and a smile.

He posted weekly 5 min videos for the complicated material and expected us to learn it all just from those videos. It would have been much better had he actually taught the difficult material in class. This made it really hard to complete the homeworks and projects. He also was not helpful when asking for help– he would just ask well what do you think and not provide any actual guidance. The TA's luckily were helpful.

However your mileage may vary. Prof. Bain is very helpful during office hours and the teaching staff are super available – there are office hours every day of the school week.

Your main grades are homework, three quizzes, and two projects. All the homework assignments you can submit multiple times until you get a 100. The quizzes are not difficult and you can drop one. The projects can be challenging, but if you go to office hours they will help you. There are also mini–quizzes and tutorials, but if you attend class you will likely get 100s on those as well. Professor Bain is a very understanding and engaging professor. He clearly knows that most people in this course are not STEM majors and teaches at a reasonable pace.

As a student whose major does not offer very promising high paying prospects, when I took this course I thought, "I'll try this out to see if I could double major or minor in computer science!" I had never taken any sort of programming before. This was a trial run. And a very revealing trial run indeed.  Reader, I started this class and felt confident. Maybe a bit cocky. Move a few turtles, draw a few shapes; I felt good about this backup career I had chosen. Then Project 1 attacked (*fire nation music*). <br><br>I knew that I would need to get the project done before it's official deadline less than 24 hours later. I eyed the clock. 12:30 AM. It was time to lock in. <br><br>I knocked out tasks easily, at first. An animation here, a landscape object there. It all was going smoothly. But then I got ambitious. I took it too far. I decided to go for one of the more complicated tasks. The clock again. 2:30. A drop of sweat beaded on my forehead. I can knock this out in one hour, I thought. The hour came and went. 3:24 AM. But I've come too far to quit now. <br><br>5:10 AM. I knew it was time to admit defeat. The project now due in less than 20 hours, and only 3/5 tasks completed. I was defeated. Until (*hopeful music*)<br><br>I went to Renato's office hours at 2:30 PM. Within 30 minutes, my problems were solved. The air was sharper, the grass greener. I could finally see the light at the end of the tunnel.  <br><br>Now, dear reader, I must admit, things only became more treacherous. With quizzes and projects due in the same week, all my grades began to slip. I adopted a mantra: "the lowest grade is dropped". My grades only continued to sink.<br><br>I know not what my fate is after this class. I can only pray for a B. But I will say this: if you decide to take this on, go to office hours. the TA's and PM's are very kind. And if you are like me, and think that Computer Science might be the right path for you?

If this is your intention, like it was mine, it will require more attention on your part outside of class to develop a familiarity such that you can employ it for these purposes.

Python is a very beginner–friendly language and the assignments and tutorials accumulate and build on top of each other. Bain is an awesome prof and gives very succinct explanations and examples. The quizzes are pretty easy to do well on if you study and do the practice exams (which are almost identical to the real thing). I do feel like some of the concepts in the quiz aren't really covered in the course, but the practice exams expose you to them beforehand, which is fine. Bain also records and posts all the slides and lecture videos, so if you happen to miss all the classes, you should be fine, but I still recommend going to class/office hours to questions. There are a lot of office hours and TAs available to help you pretty much on every day, and I highly recommend going to them for help on homeworks and projects. There is no curve and you can drop one or two low scores on homeworks, quizzes, and tutorials, so it's a pretty easy A if you put in the work.</td>

If you're a STEM student I imagine this class would be fairly easy, but as someone with not a ounce of stem in my body, I really struggled. Thankfully, office hours (so. many. office. hours.), tutorials and extra credit opportunities (you can drop your lowest grade for hw/tutorial), helped me get through this class. I felt like there was a disconnect between the level of difficulty of our lecture material and the complex homeworks/projects. The 2 projects took sooooo much time and they were very frustrating to complete. That being said, Connor is very kind and always makes himself available to students. Also, Mercy's office hours were truly lifesaving. There are lots of resources and support for this class, but if you're humanities–minded like me, then it will take a LOT out of you.</td>

The grading consists of three quizzes (you can drop your lowest score), six homework assignments (you can drop your lowest score), nine tutorials (you can drop 2), and two projects. I really appreciated how easy it was to get help in the course, since there's an online question–and–answer site as well as constant office hours all day every day. However, the help wasn't always all that helpful–– I often left office hours and tutorial sections even more confused than when I first got there. Definitely be ready to work hard if you want to take this class, but I feel like computer science and coding is a useful skill to be familiar with and so I'm glad I ended up taking this class.</td>

It teaches you the basics of python and there's so many office hours held by the professors, TAs, and PMs that make it a LOT easier to do well in this course. Largely consists of weekly homework and tutorial assignments that take maybe 2 hours maximum if you know the concepts and manage your time well. There are also 3 quizzes, one of which is dropped, and two projects that round out the rest of the grade. The projects take quite a bit longer than the homeworks, but they're not super difficult.

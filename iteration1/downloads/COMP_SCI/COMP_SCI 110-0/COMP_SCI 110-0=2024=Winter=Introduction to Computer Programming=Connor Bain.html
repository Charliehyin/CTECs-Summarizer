The first half of the quarter was way easier than the last. Towards the end, things got confusing but the TAs are incredible and will help you understand quicker than the prof. Avoid office hours with him, and just go to the TA, they are more helpful. There is homework each week but it is pretty manageable if you set aside some hours to do it. There are mini quizzes each week too but those are extremely low stakes (would not worry about them).  The course includes two projects that are not too difficult, but still challenging. In the last project, we had the option to do it with other people. There is no final just three main quizzes pretty evenly spread out.</td>

The workload is very manageable, with one pre–recorded lecture to watch each week and usually one homework assignment. I had no knowledge at all of CS before taking this class so I often found the homeworks challenging, but if you go to office hours you can easily get help and figure it out. The exams are fairly straightforward and they are generous with the partial credit. They allow you to drop one homework and exam, so it is not hard to get an A. Professor Bain is very approachable and willing to help you out.</td>

I would say if you really need another class in your schedule and also need a distro, go ahead and take it, although I wouldn't call it an easy class. It's definitely manageable, though (for the most part).  What's really nice though is that the class is structured in a way that doesn't give you work to do over the weekends, which I thought was really nice.<br><br>TAKE IT WITH FRIENDS! That's my biggest advice especially if you don't have coding experience so you can keep each other accountable and collaborate on class work and the final project.</td>

Professor Bain is so bad at teaching and the things that he teaches you are so useless  in real world. Like how is learning to do shapes and and creatures across the screen going to help me in the future? Such a waste of time and its dissapointing that there are professors like these at Northwestern. I hope he takes my advice and I'm sure other people's frustration with the class and does something to better it.</td>

Office hours and extra help are definitely necessary at times, but there are plenty of opportunities to get the help you need. The course is designed so that you can always do well if you put in the work, and even so, the workload is never super demanding. Would recommend!</td>

You have a lot of opportunities to get 100s. The homework assignments can be hard sometimes but there are a lot of office hours you could go to for help and there's also a resource called EdStem where Connor will help you troubleshoot. I had no CS experience going into the class and did find some of it difficult, especially towards the end, but you won't get a bad grade in this class even if you struggle, just make sure to go to office hours if you're struggling with coding for your homework or your project.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_64f976eb-815c-4df8-b033-b584929d6c58">Not the easiest class, but manageable if you keep up with the work and have friends/go to office hours to discuss your questions. I did get annoyed by the fact that a lot of code in assignments was pre–written for us, and you had to figure out a lot of background things going on that you had no control of to complete the code, and that got pretty counter–intuitive and counter–productive to me. I wish we could do less complex or cool things, but understand what is happening behind the scenes (utilities file) fully.</td>

I went in with absolutely no computer science experience, so I was a bit scared that I wouldn't understand anything. However, Professor Bain is an awesome professor, and the projects were fun and not tedious. As long as you put in some work and show up to class when you need to, you should be fine. If there's one piece of advice you should take, it's to GO TO OFFICE HOURS!!! The TAs are all super nice and helpful, and I definitely could not have done as well in this class without office hours.</td>

He’s so engaging, has great humour, and utilises really effective teaching methods. There is usually one HW per week that isn’t too difficult, and there are a ridiculous amount of office hours to get help with your program. Bain also records his lectures so if you can’t make some, you can just watch on x2 at home. And A LOT of the work (tutorials and mini–quizzes) are participation grades. And for the actual quizzes, he provides so many resources and practice problems. I didn’t take this course for any major/minor requirement but only because I thought I as a not–so–stemmy student can benefit from learning some Python. This course exceeded my expectations.</td>

Grades were based off of a range of assignments from mini quizzes, homework assignments, tutorial assignments, quizzes, etc. However, if you take advantage of office hours and attending class, it's easy to do well. Lectures were recorded and optional, and extra opportunities like alternate tutorials made this course very flexible and conducive to a busy schedule.

It provided a good challenge (I will admit, the final project was really difficult), but it was all doable. The PMs are more than willing to help to get you "unstuck" when you run into an issue. The best thing about this class is how incredibly it is organized. You can tell that Connor Bain knows how to actually teach and support students the best he can. A typical week usually includes a lecture on Monday, a pre–recorded lecture with a built–in mini–quiz (super easy, just a check you were paying attention) for before the tutorial on Wednesday (trying what you watching in the pre–recorded lecture),  and a homework due Friday night. There are also three midterms/quizzes (but you can drop one) and two projects. The first project is a lot of fun and the second one you can work with a group. I will say that sometimes the class quickly gets a lot harder basically overnight because a lot of new concepts are introduced at once, but it is manageable. I was never worried about my grade because it is distributed over the many forms of evaluation which is nice. Also, Connor Bain is simply the best. Go to lecture and participate in class (sometimes you even get to have whole conversations about why "Olive Drab" is the best color).  Overall, highly recommend!</td>

Sometimes he'll be passive aggressive on EdStem if you ask a dumb question, but he overall wants everyone to do well and is pretty good at explaining concepts. Also, he gave everyone rubber ducks. The difficulty of this course varies for everyone. Personally, I did not have any coding experience and did not need to go to office hours in order to get 100s on the homeworks and first project (although they did take several hours for me to puzzle out). However, I know people who spent many hours in office hours. I would try to stay on top of the homework and not look at them last minute so you have time to get the help you need. Drop policy is great––the quizzes (more like exams) didn't really work the best for my brain, but I managed to do well enough by doing the practice quizzes and I don't really feel like showing up to the last one. Take this class, but be prepared to put in a few hours (about 2–4) a week for the homework/projects (just as you would any other class).</td>

There's a lot of support from Bain and the Peer Mentors during office hours (which trust me I utilized!!)  but sometimes it felt like the homework tasks and tutorials were harder than what we covered in class.  I liked the way we could drop our lowest homework, quiz and mini–quiz grade, I also liked how he rewarded attendance with the attendance–based mini quizzes and by giving out mini rubber ducks.</td>

He makes the subject so interesting, especially if you are a non–stem major and just taking it as a requirement. He makes Python easy to understand. I am almost convinced that I should take more CS classes even though it has nothing to do with what I wanna do in the future. TAKE THIS CLASS!!</td>

He is such a good and engaging professor and he always makes lecture fun. Also, if you've never taken a programming class before and have to for your major don't sweat it. The class teaches you a lot but definitely isn't impossible, the quiz averages were always super high and same with the projects. There's also extra credit offered on the projects and quizzes so it's super helpful for your grade.</td>

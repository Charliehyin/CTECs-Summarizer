The professor is a really great guy, and he wants to see everyone succeed. However, I thought that the homework assignments and his lectures were a bit unrelated, and even though I regularly attended lecture, I had a difficult time completing the homework. But, this may also be because my tutorial section wasn't that great. You really need a good tutorial leader for this class if you've never coded before. Otherwise, I thought this class was a good introduction to computer programming.</td>

I had to take it for IMC, and it was very manageable for me as a humanities major with 0 exposure to CS. You don't really have to go to lectures; he lets you Zoom in and also uploads the entire lecture recording after class, which is really nice. The class is graded by 6 homework assignments and 4 quizzes. The homework was challenging at times, but it was really rewarding once you figured out the code. He lets you do some of the assignments with a partner, so I would recommend taking this class with a friend if you can. The quizzes were challenging too, but for some of them you could do a little project instead of the quiz. Overall, this class was pretty low–commitment and I'm glad I know a bit of Python now.

I wanted to gain a stronger understanding of Python because I've never coded before, and I believe this class does an excellent job at teaching Python from the very basics. Mike Horn is such a chill professor, and I can tell he's truly passionate about what he does and teaches. He made coding in Python interesting and fun with his TunePad program, and he also allowed for students to hone into their creative side by letting students explore what they wanted to do in the homework assignments. Rather than assigning a basic worksheet, he would assign us to make a song or draw a creature using Python, which definitely made the class more fun because we had more freedom with what we wanted to do.</td>

Going into the class, I had no prior coding experience, but I was able to grasp all of the content. Professor Horn does a great job of making the classes fun by making connections to pop culture. You are required to attend a weekly tutorial for the class (that you will sign up for during the first week of class), but the tutorials are actually super helpful for asking questions and getting help on the homework. There is typically one homework assignment per week that does require a fair amount of work. I didn't struggle too much on any of the assignments, but I highly recommend going to office hours when you have questions on why your code isn't working. (Or get a good start on the homework before your tutorial so you can ask questions then, that's what I did.) The other aspect you are graded on is occasional quizzes. (We had 4, and the first one was graded based on participation only.) For all but one of the quizzes, there was a tutorial option instead, so if you are not a huge fan of quizzes, this is a great class for you. Also, for each quiz, a study guide with similar questions to the actual quiz is given to your tutorial leader, which is super helpful to consult when studying for each quiz. The final is a significant amount of work, so I would recommend getting started on it early. Overall, I would recommend this class to anyone because coding is super interesting to learn (and was a great break in content for someone who was mostly reading long articles and writing essays this semester), though it definitely does take some patience to learn. And if you are going to take this course, Professor Horn is the person to take it with because he makes it fun and is willing to be accommodating when needed!</td>

However, the class was very fast paced and we hardly ever went back to solidify/review past material. Content is fairly easy during the class but once I got to the final project I realized how unprepared I was to complete it. This is a very easy distro and an easy grade. Weekly homework assignments that take between 1–2 hours and 4 short quizzes.</td>

For a complete beginner, Professor Horn goes through material quite clearly and pauses if anyone has questions. The homework was straightforward and gave clear directions, and asking teacher assistants about the homework was quite helpful for completing it. Office hours were great and usually not too crowded, and they were available for about 5 days a week for almost all times of the day. The only thing part I think could be improved is the speed of grading, because some assignments that were submitted took 5 weeks to 6 weeks to grade, even for basic homework assignments. For example, the final project was graded faster than the week 6 homework.</td>

I feel as if overall the class was intended to be more independent learning and going to tutorial. However, if you got a bad TA you in some way were going to struggle, for the grading on homework counted towards your grade a lot. Some TA's are more helpful than others from what I have heard. In addition, we go in between TunePad and Python, which Tune pad seemed useless. For one of the assignments on TunePad you had to compose a song or code a cover, which on my end I am very bad with music notes and struggled with this assignment, as well as all TunePad assignments. Overall, this class seemed unorganized in some way, and if you do not need to take this class I would recommend to pass on this class. The things to take into consideration for grading are Tutorials that are kind of like a discussion section (drop lowest score) 7 homework assignments(drop lowest)4 quizzes and the final project.</td>

If you have full grasp of the practice problems, you will be in good shape. The weekly homework is fairly easy as long as you understand those concepts and using Tunepad is fun!!

Mike's lecture slides really help with understanding the concepts, and he walks through examples in class, walking through the code and how to approach the problem. He runs each class in person but has a live Zoom running at the same time if students want to join through that. The homeworks are generally easy; you can usually get them done in your 1 hour weekly tutorial session. For that reason, I spent less than 3 hours a week on this class. However, the final project is very involved and kind of sneaks up on you. It was a lot harder than the homeworks and took me several hours to complete. You get about 2 weeks to do it, but office hours are only there for 1 of those weeks. Also, there were too many times where a group of students would show up to office hours (whether it be in person or on Zoom), and the peer mentor never showed up. This was frustrating to deal with, especially in the week where we were all working on our final projects. Also, the grading is very slow in this class. It's the end of the quarter and I don't know my grades from weeks ago. Mike is a great professor and really wants to help his students. Half of the class is taught in TunePad, which was a fun and creative way to learn Python! The other half is focused on Tkinter. You have the option to use either for your final project. There are 4 quizzes. Mike gives everyone a 5/5 on Quiz 1 regardless of your score. For Quiz 2 and Quiz 4, we had the option to write a few page tutorial for younger kids explaining the concepts we would have been quizzed on and walking them through code. I really appreciated this alternative option. Quiz 3, everyone has to take. Overall, I definitely recommend this class, it's very beginner friendly and fun! It's not super time consuming except for the final project.</td>

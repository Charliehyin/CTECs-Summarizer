While the assignments can be relatively hard at times, they're all homework, no tests (4 in–class quizzes), It is definitely a stimulating class, and it's a great intro to comp sci/coding.

The prof is really understanding about people's coding (or no coding) background. I found the slides to be really thorough and helpful when reviewing concepts. Your grade is determined on quizzes, homework assignments, weekly tutorials, and your final project. There is a ton of support from the numerous TA/PM office hours throughout each week. I wish that we had more practice before each quiz because I struggled a lot. They give you a quiz review sheet, but I wish that I had more questions to practice with. With homework assignments, they were challenging but really fun. I remember making music, making a wordle, and drawing hippos! The final project was really challenging, and I ended up creating a bar graph visualization based on a spreadsheet. I liked the flexibility and creativity in the work we did, but this freedom also made it challenging. It isn't impossible to get an A! There are opportunities to present your music or make a music tutorial as areas for extra credit (compensating for the quizzes or homework assignments that weren't so hot...). If I'm being honest, the lectures were super duper low energy. The prof was patient and would try to get us to be engaged, but very little participation. If I were to do this class again, I would raise my hand more in class and also talk to the prof after class for extra help. Especially in your tutorial sections, don't be afraid to ask your PM for help! In terms of PM, I do wish mine was a bit more direct. She gave me pretty vague advice, but still in the right direction. So if not your PM, then definitely go to your TA or prof! Or find friends to work through the homework with too!</td>

The professor definitely cares about students but there is a bit of a disconnect between was was taught in lectures and necessary skills for homework assignments. The peer mentors (undergrad TAs) had office hours spread out during the week to make sure everyone got the help they needed, though you often had to wait if a lot of other people also showed up during those times. Tutorials were a hit or miss depending on your peer mentor. Some of the homework was a bit more difficult than it needed to be and the final was way outside of our wheelhouse for what Horn actually taught in class (I'm confident he's not assigning the same project next year).  Quizzes were also manageable, but you do need to actually study. The class is definitely manageable but was quite frustrating at times, but I think that's just computer science and you either love or hate it.</td>

As someone wo took some computer programming courses as a kid, I was familiar with around 70% of the material already, making the class extremely easy. Homework is really light, it only took me about 2 hours to complete each weekly assignment and that was with me going above and beyond and doing a bunch of unnecessary stuff. Some of the material taught is never really tested on or needed to complete the homework, so I'd recommend focusing on studying the material that is needed to complete the homework or that will be tested on in a quiz and using that to guide your studies rather than trying to learn everything in the slides.</td>

I found many of the homework assignments challenging, but going to office hours each week was really helpful. Sometimes it felt somewhat difficult to apply the concepts learned in class to the assignments, but there were many opportunities to receive help outside of class. It was very evident that Professor Horn wanted students to succeed, and there were typically multiple office hours each day. The course was made up of almost weekly homework assignments, four quizzes, and a final project. The final project was definitely challenging, but also allowed you to see some of the more practical uses of computer science and programming with Python. Overall, I had to put in a significant amount of work to do well in this course, but I found it very worthwhile.</td>

Weekly tutorials would basically give us the answers to weekly HW because we weren't learning enough in class. Final project is a huge step up in difficulty and I know a lot of students who are struggling to do it at all. Would not recommend if looking for a chill easy class.</td>

The homework assignments started out extremely easy, and we would sometimes go through slides extremely slowly (once we went through 2 slides in one lecture). The assignments then escalated in difficulty towards the end with no warning. I overall felt like I didn't learn much, but it was a relatively easy course.

As a Mechanical Engineer major I took this course as I took EA 1 and learned MATLAB, and overall I feel like learning both languages helped me truly understand coding. The only tricky part about learning both at the same time is remembering the correct syntax for both languages like indexes and elements for lists/matrices. But in total this was a very good course for a student looking to learn Python, though if you plan to take as many CS classes as you can, understand this class doesn't fill the prerequisite for many CS classes, CS_111 learning racket is the class that fills that requirement.</td>

The lectures are dull and kinda boring, so a lot of people don't go (including myself). Most of what I learned came from tutorial (which is like a weekly discussion section led by a peer mentor/TA basically) and my own practice with the homework assignments. It's kind of annoying that Prof. Horn requires his students to use his own program for a coding assignment. It felt confusing and unhelpful, especially since the syntax was different but beginners like myself hadn't even mastered Python's actual syntax.</td>

The final for this quarter was difficult for the beginner level and I know I struggled on it, since communication with TAs can be pretty bad in terms of specifying what the rubric wants for assignments. I've had a few moments where TAs also didn't attend their own office hours which was disheartening.<br>Overall, though, I really liked the subject and the workload is very manageable and you're encouraged to get creative and have fun on most of the homework.</td>

I felt like a decent amount was self taught or I learned through google. On top of the three lectures there is a tutorial sections you have to attend for grades. It’s usually just help with homework or quiz review. I wouldn’t have been able to do some of the assignments if it wasn’t for office hours—definitely go because usually you can finish the homeworks with their help.

Some also don't seem to realize that they are a Comp Sci major and understand things far better than most of the students in the class.<br><br>There are a few showcases throughout the quarter in which you take a break from lecture and can show off your project to the class for extra credit. These were a nice break, and felt rewarding both to show others the results of your work and to get bonus points. <br><br>The weakest part that comes to mind is the end of the course and the final project. It seemed like the material started to be rushed towards the end, which may be a byproduct of the quarter system more than anything. However, more careful planning might need to go into the schedule of the material, as it felt like the content that was covered in the final project had just barely been covered by the time the lectures ended. <br><br>Also, about the exam itself, they did not explicitly specify, but they seem to have changed the format this year, or possibly this quarter. None of the PMs seemed to have seen a final project like this before, and were all quick to say that this type of module would never be used for the given task. There were also remnants of a different version of the project even in the final rubric, with it referring to "sonification."<br><br> It seems like they were not sure what the project should cover, either.

For one, I don't feel like it was necessary to meet 4 times a week (3 lectures + a tutorial session, which would've been nice to know about before registration). Lectures often started late/ended early and I feel like my time could've been spent more efficiently. Additionally, lectures were also sometimes hard to follow when the professor coded (small font, bad lighting, hard to see), and were oftentimes not super clear. Overall, very manageable course that values hard work, office hours, explanations, etc.</td>

They were also recorded and posted on canvas, which means you do not have to attend the lectures, except for when we have quizzes. The 4 quizzes were somewhat challenging, but manageable. Some of the homework assignments were also a bit challenging if you are new to computer science, but office hours and tutorials were very helpful and definitely got me through this course. Overall, I recommend this course if you want a light work load, but still relatively challenging material.</td>

Better still if you meet both criteria, since Prof. Horn does a good job going through the basics of Python. I didn’t know anything about coding or computer science before this. There is a homework assignment just about every week, but your TA will go through most of it during your weekly tutorial section, so don’t worry about it. (I have heard mixed things about the TAs’ helpfulness, so things may depend on your instructor.) There are a couple quizzes, and you are graded for attending your tutorial. The remainder of your grade is based on the final project, which asks you to make a graph/visualization based on CSV data. There are a couple extra credit/make up opportunities, and the TAs drop your lowest homework grade, so you have some room for error as well. An easy A, as long as you attend tutorial and sort out any issues with your code during office hours.</td>

Professor Horn is an excellent teacher and his in–class examples are very engaging; it's always interesting to see how he goes about solving a Python problem.

The textbook is SO helpful and can help you figure out just about any issue you have.  The homeworks are genuinely fun, and the "TAs" who grade them are fairly lenient with grading. There are quizzes every other week, but you are told the concepts that are on them, so as long as you review those beforehand they're not too bad. There is a mandatory weekly "tutorial" (discussion) section, which can help with any questions, and get help with homework, or also function as a time to get homework done if you don't have any questions.</td>

Professor Sood is a very helpful instructor and she wants the best for her students. The TA's are really attentive, patient, and supportive as well. Definitely go to office hours! I also highly recommend taking this class with friends or making friends to work on the problem sets with.

While there are some annoying parts about the course (recursion), it's super rewarding to be able to tear down your fears about programming like you'll do in this class. I encourage you to take this class. Unlike 110 (which I also took, for complicated reasons), you'll be learning in Racket, but I'm finding that understanding how to code in Racket makes you think about learning other languages in a different way, with more of a focus on understanding possibilities (Sara mentioning how to think about constructors, modifiers, etc will be forever stuck in my head) and less on "how do i do this". I highly recommend this class, even if to just make you less scared of Comp Sci.</td>

In terms of the course, the homework assignments are very doable, even for someone who has no experience in computer programming prior to this class. Lectures are online modules, and class time is usually reserved for group work and asking for help. Going to peer mentor hours is incredibly useful if you need assistance, and there are plenty of peer mentors available. Exams aren't too bad either as long as you study and look at the past exams.

There are so many opportunities for office hours to get clarification from peer mentors that even if you don’t plan ahead to attend one, chances are that there is an office hour happening at that very moment so you can seek help. I would say that doing things like exercises/ studying ahead of time (even just 1–2 days before) makes a big difference in terms of office hours because you have a more likely chance of one–on–one with the peer mentors. Only two exams (midterm and final), both of which are very fair and reasonable. BUT if you’re doing this for a distro, would recommend COMP_SCI 110 with Prof Sarah simply because Racket is less intuitive than Python. Sara Owsley is an incredible Prof – despite the class being roughly 200 or so in size, she put in a lot of effort to get to know her students.</td>

Easy A if you try. You don't really need to go to lecture, we only occasionally get a hint for the activity that week or an answer to a part of the activity. All learning takes place through weekly lecture recordings and quizzes which are slightly time consuming but manageable. Only assignments are exercises which are weekly, can be time–consuming but you can get through them a lot faster if you go to office hours (available all day throughout the week!)</td>

First of all it's taught in Racket which while they say is a powerful programming language, is completely useless and you will never use again. It's reversed classroom, where you learn outside of class and work on problems in class, and usually I think this is fine but in this class i didn't like it at all. There are there usually 2 20–30 minute lectures to watch before every class AND a canvas Quiz, which would be fine except the class attendance is also mandatory and graded so it's basically just doubling the amount of class. And in class all we do is work on homework/ungraaded assignments, which i would rather just do outside of class, so it would just be better all around if the material was actually just taught in class. Exams are pretty fair so at least there's that. Take this class if you must, it'll be fine and is easier that most compsci classes, but i dont feel like i came out of it with much applicable knowledge and it was pretty annoying the whole time.</td>

It really teaches you how to think step by step like a machine. Takes it from me, a person who cannot code for my dear life, and I managed to figure a lot of the homework out by myself. Professor Sood does a great job of explaining the code and the way that the machine carries out that code. Furthermore, the homework is much much harder than the exams themselves and they also account for most of our grades, so there is no way that you will walk out of this course failing. Highly recommend the course.</td>

She barely does any teaching. I learned how to get by in the class, not how to code in Racket. With that being said, I do have to say that Professor Sood is a nice woman and assesses the progress of the class and caters the schedule to what she thinks students need.</td>

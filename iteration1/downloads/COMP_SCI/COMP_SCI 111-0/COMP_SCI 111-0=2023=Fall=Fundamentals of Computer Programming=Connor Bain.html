Dr. Baine is a really engaging lecturer and gives many good examples for us to better understand abstract concepts about computer science. The Racket language is fairly easy to use and is really beginner friendly so there should be no fear about that. I would say that the weekly homeworks seem daunting but they are very easy and the class has many office hours opportunities both online and in–person to help with them</td>

Professor Connor Bain is probably the best professor this course could have, even on the more boring days he always brought energy and passion to his lectures. He made the course fun, and you could tell he cares a lot about the class as he would often stay after class ended for office hours to help on whatever the students needed, whether it be the tutorials or exercises.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_95b9128e-d5c4-4b78-93c5-c499a1212e2a">This course isn't too difficult, Racket is annoying to program in (and honestly a pretty useless language to learn), but I wouldn't call it difficult by any means. Bain is extremely nice, to the point that if you already have CS knowledge it's honestly a little annoying (I felt like I was being talked to like a toddler sometimes), but if you have no CS knowledge at all it's nice to have an instructor like him. I will say if you're taking the class as an elective and you just wanna try out/learn CS, take 110 instead of 111. 110 is in Python (a widely used programming language) and 111 is in Racket (a language that nobody uses), so 110 is probably more useful if you have the choice.</td>

Professor Bain helps to make the lectures entertaining, and I enjoyed the format of the class in that on Wednesdays we had tutorials where we got to collaborate with other people in the class if we needed help. There definitely wasn't a lack of support with the OH, PMs, etc.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_95b9128e-d5c4-4b78-93c5-c499a1212e2a">Racket sucks but everyone already knows that. I think Racket makes many things a lot more complicated compared to other languages, especially recursion, so I don't really understand why Racket is used to teach an introductory class. Exams are also purposely just trying to trick you and you have to catch every little trick in the code or you get many points off since some questions are worth 10 points and the exams are only 100 total. Some questions on the exam aren't trying to test your knowledge but instead are testing your ability to catch the tiniest little mistake or error that was barely covered in lecture.</td>

Coming in as someone who already had 2 years of coding experience, this class was not overwhelming and still managed to challenge me, making me a better coder in the process. Professor Bain's lectures were quite helpful in being able to learn the specifics of the Racket coding language, as it is different from almost any other language. The quizzes were very manageable, and we were given plenty of resources to prepare ourselves for them. The ethics modules were quite interesting as they gave us a chance to reflect and learn how to be more responsible people both with coding and in real life. <br>Overall, this class was a great intro CS class and I would recommend that you take it if given the opportunity.</td>

Should receive an A if all assignments are completed with full marks (can drop one), attend classes, and 82.5+ average on 3/4 tests.

However, Professor Bain is an excellent lecturer and there are a lot of resources available to students to help them succeed. I found the exercises and tutorials to be manageable, but the quizzes throughout the quarter were relatively difficult. I would recommend taking this class for a major/minor requirement, but would recommend CS 110 or a different course for a distribution requirement/elective given the intensity of the class.</td>

The professor is one of the best I have ever had at NU and he made himself available for his students way more than I would have expected.  In such a large class, it can often be easy to feel lost in the mass and not noticed by the professor, but he took care to help and acknowledge every student who needed/wanted it.  The class is difficult, but you are given all the tools to succeed.  Best advice is to start the exercises early, your brain will figure them out in the background while doing something else trust me.  Can't say enough about the professor and course staff doing an amazing job.  Only issue was when he started to crack down on attendance, it took away from the experience a bit as someone who was attending class every day (though not his fault, the fault of students who tried to cheat his system).</td>

While this sounds like it would be easy, if you have prior coding experience, you might be confused. Some things are very racket specific and thus make some assignments tedious. I also found that the practice quiz was not representative of the real quizzes. That being said there is a lot of help in this class and Bain is a really great professor!</td>

Also, to get an A in the class (assuming you have 100's on everything else, which is super easy because you get an 100 on everything, besides the homework, just for BEING there in class and participating), you just need to average an 83 on your three quizzes, which is pretty achievable. I had no experience and i struggled to do the homework, but i still was able to achieve this just by studying and reviewing the practice quizzes. <br><br>review on the professor: prof bain is super nice and you can tell he genuinely wants to help us learn. he also gives off dad energy because he tries to crack jokes and make class fun. all around, he's a super super nice guy, which is also reflected in his grading policy. that being said, his lectures are so much simpler than the assignments he assigns afterwards, and even after taking this class, i still don't REALLY know what's going on because the exercises were way too hard to figure out on my own. also, i wish he would use less CS lingo without explaining what it actually meant first, because it genuinely made me so confused in the beginning when he started by talking about things like "special forms" and "rules of computation" from the get–go and i had no idea what either of those things were. eventually, i learned through context but it was a little frustrating that i was expected to know these things from the start.<br><br>as your resident humanities kid, this was the first CS class i have ever taken. and honestly, it was pretty hard, but i did better than a lot of my actual CS major friends because Dr. Racket makes it so that everyone is pretty much on equal footing. overall, id say that prior CS experience is helpful for doing the homework, but it can actually make the quizzes harder because the quizzes are mostly debugging code. so if you're not a CS kid, make friends with people who are so that you can get help on the homework. <br><br>good luck, overall this class isn't too bad. also, you can trauma bond with your classmates. and you get a free rubber ducky from Prof Bain.</td>

His quizzes weren't too horrible, and you're allowed to drop one of the four. I will say that the last one (which you take during finals week) was cumulative and trickier than the rest. But you can drop it if you do better on the other three. Take this class with a friend if possible. You need to get perfect scores on the exercises (which take quite some time in office hours) in order to balance out mediocre quiz grades. Attend all mini–quiz lectures and tutorial lectures. His practice quizzes are very similar to the real ones. Quizzes are very short (15 questions, 50 minute time limit), so no need to panic about running out of time. Overall, Dr. Bain is a great professor but Racket sucks and you'll never use it after this class. ALSO you can't drop the last tutorial/exercise, so make sure you know that!</td>

He is, by far, the best professor I have ever had, making me fortunate to have him during my Freshman year of pursuing Computer Science. He is very enthusiastic about coding and is good at explaining concepts that one might find challenging more straightforwardly and comprehensibly. Not only that, he cares a lot about his students, which can be shown in his readiness to answer students' questions ranging from coding to recommended classes and how to improve one's coding skills. I love his grading system, especially as he acknowledges emergencies and drops the lowest grades in different grading sectors. Staying after class for office hours was my favorite since I could learn many more things. Professor Bain is engaging with ensuring class participation during lectures despite the large number of students he has. Although Racket was an "interesting" programming language to code in, I'm glad I took this class with Professor Bain.</td>

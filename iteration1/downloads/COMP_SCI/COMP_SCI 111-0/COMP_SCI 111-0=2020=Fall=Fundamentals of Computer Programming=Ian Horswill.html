It was a huge class but Prof. Horswill was very good about teaching at the right pace and answering questions.

Ian is a great instructor and he was very accomodating about issues with remote learning. Also he and Andie, the TA, would both frequently put their cats on the camera during the Zooms.<br>If you've taken AP CS, this class is a breeze.

Racket is a great equalizer language, and very useful for teaching functional coding. Ian is by far the best instructor I have ever had in coding and general wisdom. The instructors were always extremely helpful and responsive to questions, so I never felt stuck on an assignment. If you are new to coding, this class will give you a great foundation in coding, to test the waters. If you have coded before, this class will still teach you and throw some curveballs. Overall amazing course with amazing resources. Recommend for anyone who wanted to see what coding is like.</td>

I realized that the reason I hated CS in high school and got so frustrated working on assignments was that I always waited until the last minute to complete assignments, and I lacked a fundamental understanding of what my code was doing. With this course, lots of time was spent going over the basics and asking help was always encouraged. Because of that, I had a great time in this course and highly recommend it.</td>

Just make sure to not think of this as a blow off class because that is not what this class is.

I did the advanced tutorials and they were all super interesting and fun to work on, and the format worked well for me – mostly working by myself but being able to ask the other students for help. The fact that we had a full basic interpreter at the end of the tutorial series was super cool and gratifying to build.</td>

A benefit of the Panopto lectures was that they were always there to go back to and listen to if you needed to be reminded of something when working on a coding assignment, and you could do this at any time throughout the quarter, so being able to review earlier material was very helpful. The course was very fun and Ian was very engaging during class meetings. I will say that the course was very loosely structured, and whether that's a positive or negative thing really depends on the student.</td>

I didn't have any prior CS experience coming into this course, but I didn't think it was too difficult. Sometimes I had trouble with the assignments, but there were always TAs holding office hours which was super helpful. I think that if I had also paid more attention in class and spent more time outside of class trying to learn the concepts the class would have also come easier. We had micro quizzes after every lecture, and there were definitely a few that were difficult, but in general most questions were just based off of the lecture slides.</td>

Specifically, really the first half of the course is pretty basic, but eventually becomes more challenging (and offers additional challenge through weekly advanced tutorial sessions).

Using Racket was probably the worst part of the class; the actual material wasn't too bad to learn, and the instruction was excellent. I didn't like the flipped classroom structure because a lot of the time, the professor just ended up repeating the same things from the recorded lectures we watched before class.

The choice to use the Racket student languages was even more questionable, especially towards the end when we started doing more complicated things that the student languages don't support. This resulted in some features being hacked into the student languages which was less than ideal. On the other hand, the topics covered in this course were definitely the right concepts and it gave a good look at some of the different specializations within CS. Overall pretty good, but I do think the level of challenge could be increased a bit.</td>

This particular course took place during COVID(which it hopefully will be in person in the future), which allowed me to not go to any lectures. You will probably end up doing the same if you already know a decent amount of programming. If you are scared of the "recursion" part, don't be.

I thought imperative programming would be a completely different viewpoint for coding, but by the end of the course you effectively are just using racket for OOP.<br><br>For people taking this as their first CS class:<br>It probably won't be particularly fun at first. Coding has a difficult learning curve, but this class is a pretty decent intro class. If you are thinking that you just want to learn coding and take one cs class, from the people I have talked to, 110 is a better option for a one–and–done CS class experience.<br><br>Also racket isn't fun or intuitive, but you get used to it and it become easier and less painful.</td>

I think people are probably going to have mixed feelings about the pacing/difficulty because people with lots of coding experience are going to think it was way too easy and beginners are going to think it was hard, but I feel like that's just kinda how it is for intro classes. Personally, I started off with very little real coding experience (I basically only knew a little HTML/CSS), and I found this class difficult but manageable. Even if you don't know anything at first, you'll be able to more or less write basic programs by the end of the class if you put in the work, which is pretty neat :) The assignments really help solidify everything you learn in the lectures, so as long as you take the time to actually understand the content and do the homework, you'll be fine! <br><br>Everyone hates Racket when they first see it, but once you get used to it, it's really not as bad as people say! We just like to complain lol. If anything, I think Racket was actually really helpful because you only need to learn a few basic components and you can build those up into more complex programs. Plus it's designed so that you can think of everything like a function, so it really helps you get the hang of functional and imperative programming. <br><br>Ian is a really fantastic prof and a lovely human being! My fav part of class was seeing his cats barge into the Zoom &lt;3 He's very knowledgeable and passionate about CS, and you can tell he genuinely cares about helping us learn. He does a really good job of explaining the main concepts in a way that's engaging and easy to follow, and he's always willing to answer any questions you might have. Virtual learning just sucks in general, but I think he did a great job of accommodating for the situation and making sure we weren't super overwhelmed with work, which I really appreciated given how stressful this quarter was for everyone.

I started skipping the zoom lectures because they were so similar to the recorded ones and it was difficult to learn anything by just watching slideshows. The weekly tutorials with TAs were helpful but overall I found myself spending hours late into the night trying to figure out how to do the weekly exercises. It was extremely stressful and by the end I felt like I was just floating through the class without absorbing anything because I just had no idea what I was doing. My grade didn't suffer thankfully since I was able to do well on the exercises, but I'm just leaving this class with even LESS interest in CS than I did before and the pretty useless skill of operating racket. Ian's very chill and nice but if you don't have experience in CS don't take this class.</td>

BIG fan of the panoptos, since we could go back to them and relearn whenever necessary. Genius idea to have troupes, since it solves so many issues with online learning (like difficulty making new friends, not enough practice, etc.). Discord, tutorials, TA office hours were all very very helpful. I think the way this class was organized could not be any better. <br>Racket just takes a longggg time to understand.

It was at 10 pm his time, which I found to be super nice of him and definitely helped me to learn more in the class. I found Racket to be quite an easy language to understand given that I've had no prior programming experience, but I have heard from others that it may be too simple to the point its counterintuitive. The latter mainly came from those who have had prior experience with CS so I guess it comes down to personal preference.

The professors do a good job of explaining why they made the decision to use it, as it provides a good way of introducing all the core concepts that most other programming languages are built upon and I actually agreed with them. Racket does a good job of forcing an understanding of computer science fundamentals. However, I still don't think it's worth it. I feel like the costs of using Racket to introduce students to CS outweigh the benifits. I would've rather spent the quarter learning a more popular language like Java or Python instead because I feel like the points this class tried to teach with Racket would have also been doable in more mainstream languages.</td>

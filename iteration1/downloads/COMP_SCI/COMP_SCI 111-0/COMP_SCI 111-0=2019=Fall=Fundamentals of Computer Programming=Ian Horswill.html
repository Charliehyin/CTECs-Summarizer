Although many students don't like that the class is taught in Racket, it nonetheless does a pretty good job of introducing students to fundamental CS ideas – skills that are transferable across any language. At times, the syntax of Racket could be a bit tedious and annoying, but overall, the class does a good job of teaching you how to program in general, as opposed to just in one language. Pretty accessible even without a CS background IMO.</td>

It is significantly less intuitive and much harder to follow than other languages like Java despite its apparent simplicity. It falls to the trap of making it so simple that it's actually harder to understand what's going on.</td>

Ian is a very friendly and approachable professor, but basically all of the lectures were done based on some PowerPoint slides, which I really did not like because it's hard to learn how to code and problem–solve if you just see code printed on slides. Because I had programming experience, I felt like learning Racket was much more challenging because the organization and structure and syntax of the language is drastically different from anything else I had done, so I initially struggled with that, but if you at least partially do the weekly tutorial activities and do all of the weekly exercise assignments, you'll get the hang of it by the end of the quarter. That said, I learned the most from going through the week's slides before I did each assignment, and then completing and making sure I understand my work for each problem of the assignment. Doing the practice quizzes is for sure the best way to study for the quizzes, and it is really helpful that you get a glossary with the full documentation for every single procedure/method you could possibly need on each quiz. Overall, I think it was a pretty good intro course.</td>

The course acknowledged and allowed for group work very well, which I appreciated highly. The quizzes were low stress but still managed to hit on a lot of the big points of lecture. Weekly tutorials allowed for low stakes practice, which was nice, and the weekly assignments were well paced.</td>

These quizzes are pretty short (they don't involve writing original code or long answers, just a few words or making minor corrections to given code), so in my experience there's plenty of time to complete them. It's worth studying for them by doing the practice quizzes though; even if you're confident with the material, it's worth it to make sure you don't make simple mistakes (which seem to be the most common).<br><br>NOTE: This class has a weekly 50–minute discussion (tutorial) section! Caesar did not notify us of this fact when registering; hopefully this will be fixed for future quarters. Don't stress about these weekly tutorials though; you're only graded by participation (showing up and attempting them), and in my experience they're pretty chill.<br><br>If you took AP computer science in high school, it should be a pretty straightforward class (just make sure you keep up with the syntax of the Racket programming language, since it's a bit unique). I can't speak for those new to programming, but there are plenty of resources available to get help if needed (lots of TAs with office hours, Ian's office hours, asking peers, etc).<br><br>Regarding Curriculum: Some of my peers who were more experienced with CS actually found it a bit boring, teaching things they already knew, but I personally found it interesting to learn this new language and the general programming concepts that are taught through it; worst case you can "multitask" during lecture at times (I wouldn't zone out or not show up though; 90+% of the lectures had at least a few things related to Racket that even experienced programmers wouldn't know that you need to know for the assignments/quizzes). I think there are pros and cons to combining students new to programming with experienced students; on the plus side, all CS majors have a common baseline experience, and it provides an easy transition to CS in college for experienced programmers, but on the other hand, some peers I've talked to have said that they would rather have a more advanced intro class specifically for experienced programmers to avoid having to re–learn concepts or go slower than necessary. There's also the question of whether this course adequately prepares students for 211, which I've heard is much harder.<br><br>If you're a non–CS major, keep in mind that the course's main value is in learning programming concepts rather than specific programming language skills (Racket isn't widely used for practical programming in the real world). So, if your main goal is to just learn the basics of a programming language like Python, maybe look into CS 110 instead. But if you're intellectually interested in CS or want to pursue it beyond basic programming language skills, then take this; it doesn't assume any previous CS experience.<br><br>Overall, an enjoyable class that gave me an easy start to studying CompSci at NU.</td>

The assignments were definitely helpful in solidifying concepts discussed in class, and the peer mentors are great. I highly recommend going to the peer mentors' office hours if you need help on an assignment, there's pretty much endless office hours for this class so there's endless help which I really appreciated. As someone with no prior programming experience, I was a little nervous about taking this class, but the use of Racket seems to actually sort of level the playing field since we were all pretty much new to the language. Sometimes in lecture all of the people with programming experience would ask questions about things that I'd have no idea about, but I still managed to do pretty well in the course so it's not a huge deal. I personally didn't find the tutorial sessions to be that helpful, during my session we all kind of sat there in silence doing the assignment. Ian is a pretty good lecturer and tries really hard to entertain us all, but lecture could sometimes be a bit boring. If you have the choice, I would go with Sara just because I like her lecture style more (she does live examples during class so it's easier to contextualize the concepts you're talking about), but that is by no means saying that Ian is bad.</td>

I emailed him screenshots of my old and updated code the day I got my grade back, and explained that my code wasn't wrong (it just wasn't written exactly how the auto–grader wanted it written, but it still worked) and he still hasn't responded to my email; it's been over a month. I get that it's a large section so it might be hard for him to answer emails from 300 students, but he could have at least forwarded it to a TA and had them take care of it. If you're the kind of person who doesn't need help from TA's with assignments and doesn't mind having zero contact with their professor, then you'll do fine in this course. If you pay attention in lecture and take notes, the weekly tutorials and exercises actually aren't that bad.

Given that this course is required for the computer science minor, even if you believe that the course will be useless and simply a review of things you've already learned, I would recommend going into it with an open mind, as at least for me it was decently helpful in updating my understanding of computer science and making sure I was ready to take the higher–level classes in the field.

I had gotten 1 formal studies credit from AP Calc in high school, and I needed another one but definitely did not want to go any further with calc. I was always interested in learning how to code, so I took 111 to fulfill the distro. Because I'm new to coding, I did not really relate to my classmates' frustration with the clunkiness of Racket because I didn't know any different. Ian is literally the nicest, most understanding guy and it's so clear that he wants everyone to learn and is so passionate about computer science. The peer mentor program &amp; office hours literally saved me in this class–– the tutorial sessions were awesome, especially because I took the easiest level so my TA really walked us through the concepts step by step. My only criticism of Ian would be of his lecture style. He used powerpoints and just talked, which made the concepts seem super theoretical and hard to understand. I wish he wold have been coding on the board and having us follow along. Watching the lectures was kind of like watching a powerpoint about how to play the violin; you can only really learn by DOING, which was what these lectures were lacking. I learned the most by actually doing the homeworks and tutorials, because then you're applying the concepts instead of listening to him talk about them.  My most important piece of advice would be: GO. TO. OFFICE. HOURS. FOR. THE. TAS. The first few assignments I struggled through on my own, spending hours trying &amp; failing. Then, I realized you could go to office hours, sit there for a couple hours, and have the TAs help you do the homework. It was amazing because it took way less time and you walked away actually understanding instead of just doing trial and error. If you've never coded before, you can do it!!</td>

The assignments aren't too difficult either, and there is only 1 a week, so it's not hard to work ahead and finish it several days before it's due. Ian does a pretty good job teaching; he goes slow enough so the content is understandable, but he still gets through a lot of material.

The exercises are moderately challenging, but the TAs are very helpful and you can sign up for a free extension. The midterm and finals are very easy.</td>

Racket is frustrating at first, but by the end of the quarter, it makes a lot of sense. I would highly recommend this course to anyone looking to try coding for the first time, as the pace is well–suited for that, and there are lots of people in that class who are more than willing to help with assignments!</td>

The lectures were kind of boring and I didn't learn much while sitting in the lecture hall. I learned mostly from the homework assignments and tutorials where I was actually able to apply the concepts in the lectures. However, the lecture slides were useful to refer back to while coding. I really don't like language Racket, but I guess it helped teach the fundamentals of computer science. Overall I thought it was a decent introductory course.</td>

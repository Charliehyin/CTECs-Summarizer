The quizzes were very manageable once you understood the format, and you could drop your lowest of the 4 quizzes.</td>

I was unfamiliar with Racket or functional programming but the language is approachable and explained well by Professor Bain during lectures and tutorials. The weekly exercises are quite doable; I particularly enjoyed the assignments that involved the image–making library. There are quizzes instead of midterms with a provided Racket glossary and nearly all students perform well on them. While you will likely (99% chance) not use the languages taught in this course (intermediate/advanced student languages) in future CS courses or personal programming projects, it serves as a foundation for picking up other languages with a less challenging learning curve.</td>

Professor Bain is very enthusiastic about the subject and is eager to help students. There are also several PMs and TAs who host office hours daily and are a great resource for help on the homework and for help preparing for the quizzes. The homeworks can be pretty consuming and take a while to complete, but it is all manageable given the number of office hours being hosted.</td>

The class does a great job of challenging you while also not feeling too hard or overwhelming. The layout of the course with weekly exercises, tutorials, and mini–quizzes, gave students a plethora of opportunities to develop their knowledge of code both individually and with their peers.

Although the language taught in the class, Racket, is not useful in the industry, the course does help in building basic understanding and skill around programming. It's beginner–friendly, so you don't have to worry if you come in with no prior coding experience. Professor Bain is a good teacher – funny at times and good at explaining concepts, going through each one step by step. I like the way the course is set up – live lectures on Mondays, with tutorials on Wednesdays, where we practiced what we learned, and typically a lecture or review on Fridays. There is a weekly exercise, and four quizzes throughout the quarter. The code can be hard to understand at times, especially recursion, but with practice and getting help from office hours, it's pretty doable. Quizzes can be prepared for by practicing and going through the lecture slides.</td>

Once you get over that experience the course is fine, but if you've programmed before you still won't leave the course with any more knowledge or principles of programing than before. The pre–recorded lecture is a bit of extra time required outside of the class and the hw can sometimes be annoying, but the workload is fine compared to other classes. The quizzes are very easy. As long as you have paid attention to all lectures you can ace it. <br>That being said, for those without programing experience, I believe this is a very good introduction course as Professor Bain is a legendary teacher in making the content light, easy to understand, and engaging, while taking into account the size of the class he's teaching to.  I personally love his teaching style and would wish all the future professors are like him.</td>

It really does make you think about programming differently and get some fundamental ideas across well (e.g. functional prog, recursion, OOP, etc). Expect to spend a few hrs later in the quarter working on some of the longer weekly exercises. Also, attending class on Tutorial/Mini–Quiz days basically gives you free 100s on those, so def don’t skip class.</td>

The class consists of lecture on Monday, group tutorials on Wednesday, and lecture/mini quizzes on Friday. For tutorials and mini–quizzes, it's great because as long as you show up to class, you get 100. It's not a scary course at all. A lot of people hate that it's in Racket, but since I had no experience in programming I had no issues and was able to pick it up fairly easily.

I will say that the exercises every week sometimes took me several hours, but they definitely helped supplement my learning process. If you are watching the video lectures, attending in person lecture, paying attention, and working well with your tutorial group, you should have no problem succeeding in the class. Not difficult to get an A. I went random with my tutorial group and I ended up really liking them! The quizzes were difficult at first to adjust to, but once you get the hang of it they really aren't difficult. The best thing to do to study for them is practice. There are some of practice materials in canvas, and I recommend taking those over and over again until you fully understand every problem.</td>

The weekly exercises never took too much time since they were entirely based on that weeks lesson and tutorial. There were 4 quizzes and we could drop one at the end of the quarter. These were more tricky but if you were comfortable with the material it wasn't very difficult. The median score for these quizzes were always high 80's.

The PMs (peer mentors) were amazing and always willing to help (even if they were not leading my tutorial group). The course utilizes a variety of teaching/communication strategies (lectures, flipped–classrooms, exams, projects, CampusWire forms etc.) and office hours were available pretty much every day of the week, several hours a day.

Functional programming is a bit different from more traditional programming paradigms, so even students like myself with substantial prior knowledge of programming can take away valuable knowledge from this class. This class also appeared very manageable for those without previous experience, and the averages on the quizzes were relatively high (~85–90%).

Professor Bain is also very willing to help anyone and his office hours were so helpful to me. There were also many peer mentors and TAs so you could ask them for help too.<br><br>However, it's important to note that Racket is a very confusing programming language. CS 111 is taught in Racket because it levels the playing field... meaning whether you've been programming your whole life or have never written code, Racket will make you suffer. But, again, there is plenty of assistance available and Professor Bain is very good at his job so he makes things easy to understand. As long as you start the homework early to give yourself time to go to office hours, you'll do just fine. Don't be afraid to ask for help; there's 3 dozen people getting paid to help you and hundreds of other students taking the class that you can ask.

Sure, it's different from what we're all used to, and yes, at times it's inconvenient, but that's really all it is. This class is great. Even if you already know how to code, if you haven't learned functional coding, you're going to learn a lot. One thing I was annoyed with was the fact that all of our lectures were online, but we were still required to be in class for at least the first half of the quarter. While this later changed when Professor Sood realized that people were getting around the attendance form anyway, oftentimes, I found myself more stressed about making it to a class where I was doing work I could entirely do on my own time than I really should have been. While I do like to go to class because I have friends there and it gets me going in the morning, it was a great improvement to not have to go to class if I really really didn't want to. Overall, this is a pretty easy class if you have CS experience. If not, there's definitely a learning curve, but everyone is so so helpful and wants to see you succeed.</td>

She is so intelligent and knowledgeable, and she knows how to break down intro CS so that it makes sense. The assignments in this class are not too difficult and the language is not nearly as bad as everybody says it is. There are TONS of office hours, so it's hard to fall too far behind. Overall, very good class, highly recommend to anyone looking to get a taste of what CS is like.</td>

The flipped model seems nice in theory but it is very hard to fall behind so make sure you don't. Exercises are the same weight as both the midterms so make sure you are getting a 100 on every one and you'll be fine</td>

Professor Sara does a really good job of pacing the class in a way that makes topics easily digestable even as they build on one another. The workload is extremely manageable and spaced out well so that you're never feeling rushed. There isn't a lot of homework besides weekly exercises to complete and videos to watch to better familiarize yourself with concepts further discussed in lecture. Do these to the best of your ability and you'll be successful.</td>

Racket is not as horrible of a language as people say! Professor Sood is an incredibly kind and understanding professor who runs a very well–organized and effective class, and the PM system is very helpful. The projects are complicated, but if you go to class you will receive a LOT of guidance and help.  The exams are also very straightforward – just make sure you know how to read other people's code.</td>

It was annoying at first since it was not as "neat" as Python and C or any other language. But as time goes by, I really started to appreciate how clean this language can be. <br><br>Aside from the language, the content is pretty useful in terms of giving an intro to programming I guess. Exams are pretty fair. One note though, for some reason attendance is mandatory, yet most content is delivered through videos and handouts. This makes attendance very much unnecessary to learn the content and apply them in useful ways. Besides from that, overall a pretty decent course.</td>

It uses a language called DrRacket which isn't too popular. It takes a little bit to get used to it but after a little bit you understand how it connects the different approaches to programming. The teacher is great; she wants us to learn and really internalize how computer science can be used for relevant situations.</td>

However, it did take a little bit for me to adjust to programming in Racket, which isn't exactly bad, but it just involved a different way of thinking. I was used to Java and Python, so Racket seemed slightly backwards at first. <br>Prof. Owsley ran the course as a flipped classroom, so we worked on exercises in class and watched lecture videos for homework. While I was initially skeptical of this method, I actually did come to appreciate this format.  Prof. Owsley and the PMs were very helpful and approachable, so I would definitely recommend this course with her if you need to take it!</td>

The most crucial takeaway for me was the dual emphasis on design and reasoning—understanding that being able to diagnose and debug, akin to a detective or doctor for code, is as vital as crafting code that is comprehensible for both oneself and others. This course has not only equipped me with technical skills but also instilled in me a deep appreciation for the nuances of programming, making it a uniquely enriching educational experience.</td>

The class is taught with asynchronous lectures, then class time is used for review/questions/activities/independent work on assignments. Office hours are plentiful. Two midterm exams in class, 20% each, 8 assignments (One every week pretty much), very small virtual quizzes that you complete after each lecture. I thought the discussion (There is 1) and reflections (2) were not very useful for a very introductory comp sci class, but I still recommend. You will need to get used to asking for help.</td>

The great thing about the class is that there are a LOT of peer mentors, and if you ever need help with an assignment, there is likely a zoom open at that very open; if not, you can also ask questions through an online website and someone will respond quickly. Racket (the language you'll learn) definitely takes a while to get adjusted to if you have coding experience, but is not as overwhelming as some make it to be. Take note that this class has a flipped classroom, so you end up watching videos and taking mini quizzes before each class to learn the topic for that day.</td>

Class time is also dedicated to practice, whereas lectures are supposed to be watched before class (Generally, they don't take the whole 50 minutes). Thus, learning outside of the classroom and applying skills in class was very helpful for me. The first exam was quite straightforward as well. The only thing I would say is that the cutoff for an A is 94, and there is no curve in the class. However, Professor Sood makes this very attainable if you put in a bit of effort.</td>

I would have enjoyed class significantly more if lecture time was actually spent with the professor teaching the content rather than having us work on practice sets because, as research shows, learning from recordings is not conducive to long–term knowledge and success.

The flipped method, while perhaps helpful for some people, wasn't my favorite approach to studying. It was nice to have the study materials to study by yourself, but I would loved it if prof. Sood went over problems during the lectures instead of letting us go through problems by ourselves and answering any questions we have. Though I realize this is just a preference thing. Prof. Sood is super nice and helpful. Attendance is required, and homework is 40% of your grade while two (non–cumulative) midterms are another 40%.

Prof. Sood was very supportive of our learning. During lecture, she would walk us through parts of the exercises we were doing and give clear explanations of concepts. For instance, she used a pack of gum to give us a simple explanation of recursion (and gave us this explanation again quite a few more times). The Peer Mentors (there were a lot of them!) and TA were also supportive and helpful. For me, the only main downside to this class is that it's taught in Racket, which is a teaching language that's pretty much only used at Northwestern. Although it was fun to code with Racket, the class didn't give me immediately applicable information about how to code in "the real world." If you're only going to take one compsci class at Northwestern, you might consider taking one that teaches a more commonly used language (for example, COMP_SCI 110 teaches Python).</td>

The only real complaints are with the structure of the class and Racket itself. Class is structured backward: you watch video lectures before class to learn the content and then take a mini–quiz (easy quizzes, act as a grade booster) to prove you did so. And then in class, you work on the weekly exercises or specific assignments covering the topic of that day. While it's nice to have in–class time to do work, motivation to watch the videos before lecture is lacking. There's 1 homework exercise due every week which isn't too bad, especially if you use your resources (peer mentors, office hours, etc.), they shouldn't take more than a few hours and a lot of that you can do in class. Finally, Racket is obviously not a language you're really going to use in the future whatsoever, so while its basic structure is good for learning computer science fundamentals, it gets tedious and honestly annoying that you'll never use it again.</td>

The exercises are manageable and the exams aren't very hard, but coding in DrRacket is a very frustrating task as the syntax is unlike a lot of other languages. Racket is also not used regularly outside of Northwestern so this course felt kind of useless.</td>

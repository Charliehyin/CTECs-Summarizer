Any reproduction, republication or redistribution of this site's content is prohibited without the express permission of Northwestern University.<br><br>In the last two weeks of Winter Quarter 2020, students were strongly encouraged and subsequently required to leave campus as a result of a public health emergency. Faculty redesigned and rescheduled final assessments, in some cases overnight. As a result,&nbsp;CTEC&nbsp;response rates may be lower, and quantitative feedback may be less robust or may reflect the turmoil of the time.<br><br>For more information about the CTEC Guidelines please visit our website: <a href="http://www.northwestern.edu/ctec/guidelines/index.html">http://www.northwestern.edu/ctec/guidelines/index.html</a><br>&nbsp;</span>

The first few weeks were pretty manageable, but I found recursion to be very difficult. A lot of the programming assignments also take a lot of time, and although the tests are not too difficult if you understand the code in the lectures, a few small mistakes can lower your score significantly. The exams and the homework are weighted equally, though, so it is possible to make up for mistakes on tests. Also, Racket is a confusing and nonintuitive language, and there were many times when I was stuck trying to figure out how to write a line of code that I could have easily written in another language.</td>

The programming language, Racket, is not an important language that you will end up using in your career, however, the course does a good job in teaching you how to think like a programmer if you do not already know how to. Sara is a good instructor and walks through all the processes that are important in a slow way that helps everyone understand what they should know. If you are already familiar with programming in any way, this course will probably not benefit you. All work in the course including the exams are pretty easy.</td>

Sara is an amazing instructor, really engaged in the subject and the lectures, and cares a lot about her students. There's so many sources that you can use to get help in the course, both from the TAs and Sara herself. The tutorial sessions help you a lot, but make sure to look over the lecture notes beforehand if you didn't go to class because you'll be lost. If you're planning on skipping class or not going at all, make sure to look over the lecture notes, and actually do the assignments because it'll help you understand things. That being said, just go to class and listen in sometimes because that'll be more useful. Plus, they're really interesting because Sara is a great instructor and public speaker.</td>

Don't fall behind and go to a lot of office hours. Sara is amazing but a 300–person lecture can only go so far in explaining tough concepts. study for the exams in groups, ahead of time, and don't worry because the assignments stay about a week behind the lectures. The serotonin rush of learning how to code a game is amazing but may take a zillion hours to attain.</td>

Sara is a great professor but often went a little too fast for me. She stops for questions when she goes to fast but if you aren't sure what to ask, which nearly always happened, she'd just continue on the same as before. If you are new to coding and struggling, GO TO OFFICE AND PEER MENTOR HOURS, especially with help on assignments–– it will save you in this class!</td>

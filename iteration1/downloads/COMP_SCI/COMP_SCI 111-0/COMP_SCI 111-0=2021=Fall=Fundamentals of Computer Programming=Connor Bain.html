Professor Horswill was an excellent instructor and was always happy to answer questions.

They certainly made this class as great as it was, and have fostered a great interest in computer science for me.<br>Of course, this course is taught in Racket, which may seem like a strange language for anybody that has programmed in other languages before. However, as I put the time into it, I came to appreciate it for what the incredible language that it is. In my opinion, it is an intuitive and beginner–friendly language, that does not overwhelm you with pre–defined higher–level procedures, but has these procedures if you don't want to construct them yourself. Looking back, it is a near–perfect language to teach an introductory programming class in, even if it isn't a language most people program in outside of this class.<br>In all, this class is one that I know that I'll feel nostalgic for. It is a truly wonderful introduction to computer science, and is everything and more than I expected it to be. Thus, I could not recommend it more highly for anybody interested in programming.</td>

Having taken CS in the IB program (equivalent of AP), I must say that although the course started smoothly, the ideas and concepts came in a confusing order even If I was somewhat knowledgeable around them in a way that I didn't feel I had a definitive way to go about mastering them fully. It is a challenging course by default but it should have better flow. I think Ian's teaching style of a "flipped course" with us having to watch the lectures beforehand did not end up working for most people. I found myself not understanding the lectures very well at times because of how abstract the explanations of concepts were, and I have talked about people who were completely new to CS that had even more trouble in that and had to put an illogical amount of effort to do well in the course. Lastly, i think the evaluation method could be improved. More questions on the quizzes for more points and variety in question styles!</td>

I only took it because there was nothing else open and I had a really late registration time. I thought I might be interested in compsci, but I had no way to tell. Racket is supposedly a confusing language but I have no comparison. The class is split between compsci majors who need 111 for the requirement (bc they need to learn racket) and then others who don't know what they're doing and it's really hard to keep up/grasp concepts. Ian teaches the class reverse lecture and there's no point in going to class you won't be able to pay attention (his long, flowing hair is distracting). I don't think this is a good intro class to coding, but at least I don't hate compsci yet it's just ridiculously hard to jump into a class with a bunch of experienced coders that ace the "quizzes." Ian's a chill dude watch for his cats. Take 110 first if you don't have experience.</td>

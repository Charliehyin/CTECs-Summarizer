Structured as watching videos, take a quiz, and complete an assignment. No tests for this quarter. However, the programming language is entirely Racket (which is a dialect of Scheme I think). It's super confusing in relation to Python and you can't do much with the language. I also think it's less intuitive, but it's used well in this course.</td>

Professor Sood did a great job of keeping you on top of your assignments and towards the end was very understanding of difficult times during the quarter and offered grace periods as well as a week with no extra learnt material (during midterms week). The class uses Racket which was something I had never heard of prior to taking the class but I actually enjoyed learning how it functioned. Sadly, most likely will never use it again after this class but I am certain the concepts we learned will be applicable in more advanced CS courses. I honestly loved the asynchronous teaching style of the course and the flexibility of resources available for help.</td>

This was easily my hardest class this quarter, despite it being a beginner level CS class.

It felt to me like a very counterintuitive language. I didn't like that the difference between functional and imperative programming was not laid out at the beginning, because I feel like that would have helped me understand Racket a lot better. That being said, Prof. Sood is good at explaining things, and the peer mentor during "team meetings" was very helpful, guiding me through issues I had rather than simply telling the answer. The team meetings weren't very team–like though, basically just me interacting with my PM. Despite the convoluted language, I feel like this was quite an easy course.</td>

Sara is an amazing prof, very friendly, and she puts so much into this course to make it beneficial for everyone. There are 2–3 weekly quizzes on videos (flipped classroom) that are very easy, no trick questions, then an exercise due each Friday that's not too bad. This course is very accommodating; during midterm weeks Sara made sure to lighten our load on the quizzes and towards the end of the quarter she was super generous with extensions (during finals week giving us all a 5 day extension!)

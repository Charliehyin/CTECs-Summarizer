I liked the flipped classroom set up a lot and it made it super easy to get ahead if you knew you were gonna have a busy week. Sara is great, super kind and approachable. Lots of peer mentors and office hours which was super helpful to. There will never be a time when you're confused that you won't be able to get help.

The class is basically taught asynchronously with videos and mini quizzes due each lecture, but those are simple as long as you watch them. The exercises were not bad, and there are only two exams with no final. Overall, Racket seems like a strange language to learn, especially with prior coding language, but taking the class with Sara was great and it provides pretty good foundational knowledge.</td>

The class isn't easy, but if you put in enough time, you'll do fine. Also, you can basically spend no time every week because the homeworks are similar each quarter and the quizzes are short, so you could theoretically ask people for answers (or guess, they're not that hard). I wouldn't recommend this at all, because the videos/quizzes are really short (30 minutes, which is short for a lecture. Put it on 2x speed and its 15 minutes) and the homeworks help you learn/practice for midterms, which basically only require you to know how the functions and syntax work.</td>

Professor Sood is really helpful; by far the most helpful teacher I've encountered here at Northwestern. She genuinely cares about her students and is very chill with the deadlines of the assignments. Great things to say about the class and teacher. Definitely take it for an intro into comp sci.</td>

Racket is an...interesting language but I absolutely loved this course and the professor. The assignments were very consistent in what you had to do each week and there are plenty of opportunities for extra help both inside and outside of class. Don't get me wrong, this class is difficult for beginner programmers. I would say it starts off relatively easy, gets really hard near Week 7–8, then calms down. Exercises were fairly straight forward and everyone kind of worked together to solves issues that another student may have had. If you need a math distro in Weinberg and you're not good at math, take this course.</td>

I wouldn't take the course out of the program. Before I took it, I would have said something different. I had already taken almost all of the breadth courses for the CS major before taking this course, but to be honest, I wish I had taken this course first all those quarters ago. It is fundamental to the major.</td>

It's not very hard, just go to class (it's free points) and do the assignments and ask for help from the many office hours. You'll probably do well. You probably are taking it because you have to or are considering a minor. If you wanna "try" comp sci CS_150 is probably more practical but unfortunately if you're going for a minor you have to take CS111 anyway.</td>

Sara is an awesome professor who is super understanding and patient with her students. There were also a ton of peer mentors in this class, so whenever I needed help, it was easy to get it. As someone who hadn't coded before and had no experience with computer science, I found this class to very informative and manageable, and I did not mind racket. The class is structured in a flipped classroom, where you watch videos for homework and go over problems in class. There are mini quizzes with each video that you watch, which are super easy as long as you pay attention. There are weekly exercises, which also aren't super challenging, but can take some time to figure out. We also had two midterms, with no final. I did not find these midterms to be difficult. As long as you do a couple practice midterms before you'll do fine. I would highly recommend this class to anyone who is interested in computer science.</td>

After functional, it introduces you to imperative and object–oriented programming, which is used heavily in cs. Its good in that it doesn't completely expose you to everything in these disciplines, but provides a slow and gentle gateway into these styles of programming. The assignments were also conducive to mastering and exploring the material, and the midterms were fair too.</td>

This would have helped, but much of class time was spent working individually or in groups on exercises, so there is little incentive or reason to actually go. The exams were fairly easy imo; just study the night before and maybe a bit the morning of and you should do fine.</td>

Midterms were relatively straightforward, and projects were usually not challenging, though I know some of my classmates struggled at times. The professor seemed very hands–off at times, so you often worked at your own pace to learn the content and do assignments.

I personally am not a fan of the flipped classroom model, although Professor Sood's lecture videos were vey polished and great to review; I often didn't have much of a reason to show up to class beyond the participation points, and so I didn't get to know students as well as I might have with a non–flipped model. If you have some amount of CS background, this class can be very easy. The assignments took me less than an hour a week.

The exams were fair and Sara is a super nice professor. It is flipped lecture, which means you could be watching up to an hour of lectures before each class, which isn't the most fun, especially when attendance to class is required (you work in small groups on in class assignments).</td>

With Professor Sood the class was set up as a flipped classroom with video lectures for homework and graded attendance with in class activities where TAs would provided if needed. Professor Sood had little direct interaction with members of the several hundred person class due to the nature of the course, but she was very approachable with both class related and other more general CS questions. Even though Racket doesn't seem to be a useful language, I recommend this class for anyone with a moderate interest in CS. Otherwise, 110 is probably better. <br>TLDR: easy course, predictable exams, good teacher/TAs</td>

I'm still not sure why we're learning it, but I guess it was a good way for us to learn the fundamentals of coding and what different types of coding is like. The flipped classroom model can be really convenient, especially if you're in a time crunch during midterm season (aka the whole quarter after the first two weeks). I also appreciate that you don't really need to go to class – you can just submit your work for that day and get credit.</td>

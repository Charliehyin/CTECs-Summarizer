That said, I found all the assignments way more interesting and rewarding to complete. The final project ended up being a lot of work my partner and I, but it was satisfying to see a playable game that we had built from scratch when it was all done with. I feel like 211 with Jesse gets a bad rep but honestly this was my favorite CS class so far, and the grading system was pretty generous. If you are worried about the jump from 111 or 150 to 211, then I definitely recommend trying to learn some C beforehand, since it is very, very different from Racket and Python.</td>

I would not say the coursework is hard, there is just a lot of it. What makes this course difficult is that Jesse and the TAs are sometimes difficult to reach or work with. There were only a few TAs who made office hours worthwhile and Jesse uses lecture time as an opportunity to show off coding techniques that you probably don't need. The class is poorly managed and a lot of the material halfway through the quarter was missing, so a lot of self–teaching is necessary.</td>

Professor Tov is super super nice and willing to support students. He can be kinda confusing in his demonstrations in class, but I love his office hours. He really cares about his students. The first half of the class was pretty hard, but it gets more interesting when we started to write games ourselves.</td>

There is only a 1 percent penalty for each day late for each assignment which is very nice. But this is lowkey kind of a trap and can put you very far behind especially since there is a hard deadline on the final code, which they don't really communicate and I missed.

Early on in the class, I had no complaints about the material––C is an annoying language, but the memory management stuff is useful. During the C++ half of the course, the class definitely started to break apart at the seams. Lab assignments 6–8 never got posted, and Campuswire was full of questions that never got answers from TA's. But hey––it just seems like Jesse needed to hire more TA's for the end of the term. No major complaints about the course content.</td>

But once you get through it all, you will be surprised at how much you learned in this course. I had no knowledge of either C or C++, but at the end of this course I was programming a classic video game all on my own, and it was unbelievably satisfying when it was done. Do NOT fall behind on the assignments, they will stack up! Make sure you give yourself at least one more day than you think per assignment, since the debugging will take a while.</td>

Things were always late to be put up and the last part, which involved labs for making games (which is very important for the final project) were never really posted. This made it really hard to figure out how to make a game in the end and we had great difficulty doing that in the end. Also, lectures were just pre–recorded from some previous quarter.</td>

It was okay in the sense that the homework were do–able and that we didn't have any exams BUT the homework was also really difficult and takes a LOT of time. The professor also doesn't give much introduction to the assignments so every week it's just a staring contest with the 13 page assignment pdf trying to figure out what is even going on. Certain office hours with certain TAs are helpful, Jesse's OH was helpful if you aren't easily intimidated, but there are some TAs who are unhelpful or condescending or both. I would suggest getting started on HWs early so you can go to office hours when there are less people. Also, his lectures are so dry and boring and LONG and I just watched them on 2x speed while eating breakfast and retained just about zero information. Not sure if that's my fault or his so take that with what you will.</td>

I did not think it was particularly difficult, everything just took a lot of time. For a lot of the HWs I would have to look at them for about an hour before actually beginning to code and then writing and debugging would take multiple hours. Make sure you have a good partner to work this as this makes it much more doable.</td>

Tov is a super nice dude, but I feel like he's one of those people who's so good at what he does, he doesn't really know how to talk to newbies (I've only taken cs110 and cs11) – which definitely makes it difficult when trying to read the pdfs and understand the lectures. <br>You have 2 projects solo and the rest with a partner – it's definitely important to have a good partner (I think some people come in knowing others, but I found a partner at random and it was a good fit).

I was honestly so scared for it because past CTECs were very mixed, but I'm really glad I decided to take it. It's definitely tough if you're like me and don't have much coding experience outside of the CS intro sequence, and the lectures can be really hard to follow, especially given that we were online this quarter. However, I truly learned so much from this course and I feel much more confident in my programming abilities. You pretty much go from being completely clueless about C to being able to code little games in C++, which is so cool!! <br><br>Jesse is extremely knowledgeable and has lots of interesting programming info to share, plus he's so understanding if you're struggling with something. I genuinely do feel like he wants us all to succeed, and his course structure was very considerate of the challenges of online learning. Definitely don't be afraid to bug him for help –– he's usually very willing to give explanations for things if you need it!<br><br>My advice for this class would be to start assignments as soon as possible. The work really piles up fast, so don't procrastinate! I also cannot stress enough the importance of going to office hours for this class!!! If you've never gone to office hours before, start going now. Go as soon as you start to fall behind on assignments –– I promise it makes all the difference. Honestly, I even found the lectures to be less helpful then just going directly to office hours or live meetings with Jesse to ask about how something worked.<br><br>Overall, I would definitely recommend this class! It's a LOT of work, but you'll come out of it a better programmer if you put in the effort.</td>

My biggest piece of advice is to not be scared of this class, but to be ready for it. I spent ~13 hours per week on the assignment and I would start on them the day they were released. If you pay attention in class and go to office hours often, you will also be fine in this class. Be prepared to put in a lot of work for HW4 and HW6, but all of the assignments are more than doable.</td>

The most important thing is to have a good partner for the coding assignments. They are fair even though they do require a lot of time spent coding and in office hours. I'd say my partner and I spent a few hours most nights from Sunday to Wednesday/Thursday working on the assignments, and some time during the day in office hours. Brandon isn't my favorite – he's a great speaker, but he isn't very approachable. I stayed after class once or twice to ask a question and he answered it as if it was obvious and I was dumb for not realizing it. Also, as more and more class time was spent on live coding demos, I paid attention less and less. They are pretty hard to follow. The material itself isn't very hard but it's a little bit hard to understand how it is implemented when we aren't using a lot of the abstract concepts in our assignments. Most of the quizzes were also fairly easy. Overall, this class isn't super hard but does require a substantial time commitment. I took it at the same time as taking cs 214, which I was cautioned against by my advisor, but I had no issue taking them concurrently. If anything, the data structures we learned about in 214 were helpful for 211.</td>

However, one aspect of the way the course was run that could use improvement is the office hours. Generally, I would have to wait at least an hour to be helped in office hours. This was honestly pretty stressful and I would have to spend entire days waiting for help on a tough project. I think this is in part due to a high demand in OH but also due to the fact that TAs will spend 30+ minutes with a single group. When you do get help, the instructors are helpful, but this class is pretty time consuming and can be stressful.</td>

I came into the class with object–oriented programming experience with Java and Python, so I was familiar with the OOP side of C/C++. The only topic that I had a bit of difficulty with was pointers/memory management in C, but I found it relatively easy to pick it up. My biggest complaint is that I really disliked that the class switched from C to C++ near the end of the quarter. It felt like I didn't get enough practice/experience with either language to do anything useful with it.<br><br>I found the homework to be slightly time consuming at times, but for the most part, the instructions practically laid out exactly what you had to do. The homework felt more like translating written instructions into code rather than traditional coding assignments.<br><br>Overall, I thought the course could be more challenging, but I enjoyed it and learned a good amount that I didn't know before.

I will say, the lectures were on the lengthier side and you kind of just tuned out after a certain point but because the lecture material was so good and everything was recorded, it was easy to refer back to. As a first–generation low–income student I applaud the professor for making the course approachable to people who have never touched or seen C/C++. We had the opportunity to work in partners for 4/6 of the homework assignments as well as the final project. We had quizzes which were small assessments of what we had learned and for the most part they were fair but at the same time coding quizzes without resources allowed does not make much sense in the real world. It was definitely a difficult course but office hours and all the resources the professor Ghena gives are plenty to make it through the course. All the lectures were also recorded (which I hope continues in the future) making it easy to refer back to them. I do wish we covered more towards the end of the course on implementation of the things we learned (such as use of smart pointers, polymorphism, inheritance and whatnot) but I do understand time is limited. Another concept we did not cover at all was that of composition (which I learned about while doing the final project) and maybe that could be mentioned as well. Overall though, amazing course that is not overwhelming as is (and hope it does not become so).<br>The course was graded as follows: 60% homework, 5% labs, 10% quizzes (4 of them), 25% final project.</td>

He's great at conveying the content on a level that everyone, no matter their coding proficiency/background, can understand. This class will challenge you most through the homework, so start them early and go to office hours early in the week (or long before the assignment is due). Office hours tend to fill up and wait times increase as the deadline approaches. The homeworks themselves are actually pretty interesting, and if you (are able to) pick your final project carefully, the final can be fun. There's a substantial time commitment for this class, so be ready to spend a while on the assignments if you're like me (not a coding god).</td>

The jump from 150 to 211 is a huge jump conceptually, but that also made the class very interesting. I had never dealt with memory, command line, or C before this class, and I feel like this class did a decent job at introducing these concepts. The assignments take a long time, but they were mostly fun and felt meaningful to the overall course objectives. My complaints about this class are that the assignment guides sometimes don’t cover everything, and so that lead to me getting lost quite a few times, but office hours is always helpful. My other complaint is the written quizzes, just felt like they were not very useful for this course. <br>Overall, I think this class is pretty decent, it can get difficult, but that’s what office hours are for.</td>

If you've taken CS214 before this class, you'll probably find that the homeworks are of a similar level of difficulty and time consumption. I was not a fan of the four quizzes we were given, as they varied wildly in level of difficulty and you never really knew what to expect. With all that being said, Branden is a good lecturer and I suggest taking this class with him if you can.</td>

The difficulty peaks at week four (my partner and I unfortunately worked on that assignment for about 24 hours that week), but it doesn't get much easier from there. You will feel very comfortable coding in C and C++ by the time you are done with this class, which is great. Branden is a super kind professor and the TA's are amazing. Take advantage of office hours. For quizzes, I studied for all of them but I think I would have done the same on them if I didn't study because it is based on general understanding and syntax so if you're understanding the homework assignments, you should be fine (they quizzes were not necessarily easy for me though). I took this class after 214 and it was nice having data structures under my belt because went over linked lists and vectors but you'll be fine if you haven't yet taken 214. Also, the homework pdfs provided really great guidance. I was intimidated by the CTECs coming into this class, but it was not as bad as the CTECS made it out to be and you will be fine.

There are no exams for this course, so I personally found that it is a lot easier to get a good grade in this course than in other CS courses that have exams. There are occasional lab assignments that take no more than an hour maximum to complete and are extremely easy, and there are weekly coding homework assignments that are definitely way more time consuming. A lot of the homework assignments can be done with a partner, and some are more difficult and time consuming than others. The office hours are so amazingly helpful, and I attend multiple sessions weekly. The PMs are all super competent and will help with any problems with your code, so I cannot recommend taking advantage of office hours enough. To summarize: the course is really helpful for learning C and C++, and although the assignments can be time consuming, if you pace yourself and use the resources provided you will likely do well.</td>

Unfortunately though, a lot of the time it felt almost self–taught. Jesse is incredibly smart, and often showed us some cool things in both C and C++ that we could do. However, it often felt like he almost forgot that most of the class was seeing this stuff for the first time, and went incredibly quickly –– too quickly to actually learn. By the end, the class periods weren't even really helpful to go to, because anything in the homework we more or less needed to figure out on our own. Branden sometimes seemed a little more "with it" and understood what level of programmers we were at. All of that being said, both Jesse and Branden were really nice and super helpful with the MANY questions asked in office hours or on campuswire. Don't be scared to take this class, but definitely be ready for it. Be ready to spend many hours on all of the homeworks, but especially HW4 and HW6.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_76389db6-41e6-4091-b26a-78b40356017c">This is a hard class, both in terms of content and workload (Taking this class feels just as if you are taking 1.5 classes). Homework assignments are a big part of this class, you learn mostly from struggling on your assignments, not lectures. You would probably expect yourself to spend a long time trying to make sense of how the homework program works. If you got stuck on it, ask the TA during office hours. The TAs are pretty helpful. Asking them is faster than working on it alone.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_76389db6-41e6-4091-b26a-78b40356017c">The class definitely isn't easy, but it's not impossible. If you enjoy coding, the weekly homework won't be that bad either. Though, definitely go to office hours. The assignments do take a while to do but use OH if you're stuck rather than spending too long on the same thing.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_76389db6-41e6-4091-b26a-78b40356017c">This class was definitely very challenging, but I think it was challenging in a good way. Yes, the assignments were very long and took up half of my week, but the difficult nature of these assignments is what allowed me to learn so much about programming and made me a lot more confident as a program. If you are thinking about taking this class, don't let the fact that Jesse is teaching it scare you. If you put in the work every week you will get a lot out of it. That being said, office hours are super helpful, especially Jesse's as he knows a lot about programming and is the most familiar with assignments that are given. Also, definitely get a partner for all the assignments where a partner is allowed, even if you don't know anyone in the class (you can still go random). I went random and it worked out very well as my partner and I were constantly bouncing ideas off each other which made completing assignments a lot easier.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_76389db6-41e6-4091-b26a-78b40356017c">Reviewing the course: Jesse is a great prof and seems like a really nice guy. He was good about answering questions both during lecture and after. He always responded to my emails (though he's not one of those profs who will email you back in 5 minutes, so keep that in mind). We were sort of constantly slightly behind this quarter, but that's because of the whole 9 week thing, and Jesse did a good job accommodating for that by moving things around to make sure everybody had enough time to get a full understanding of the given topics. I kind of feel bad about how much I took advantage of the late policy, because ultimately it's a really good thing to have in place for students who work hard but are genuinely struggling. I'm glad this class works this way instead of being unnecessarily difficult.<br><br>For students: You can do well in this class if you're willing to put in the effort, even if it feels like things aren't really clicking at first. The pointer vs. reference stuff can be confusing, as can the malloc and free stuff, so pay extra attention to those parts. I ended up reading extra about it online in order to fully "get it," but you can also talk to Jesse/the TAs. The late policy is very forgiving, which helps, but it's still way better to have stuff in early because you can do early test runs on your code that help you raise your score. With the tests and help from Campuswire, you can significantly raise your grade on an assignment–– it's always worth resubmitting and talking to Jesse/the TAs. Also, find a partner you like, because you'll end up spending many hours together. You don't NEED a partner, but if you're taking this course online, it's just... really nice to have someone to talk to.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_76389db6-41e6-4091-b26a-78b40356017c">For the professors: Branden was great at more simply explaining some of the things that Jesse brought up. Overall, he was quite friendly and accessible. For some reason Jesse gets a bad rap in his CTECs, but I thought that his lecture videos were super helpful, and he was happy to help explain things if you didn't understand them. He's a little direct (not in a bad way) but don't be afraid to talk to him.<br><br>Overall, I thought that this course did a good job of making you learn how to use C and C++ effectively; there's a bit of a learning jump when you switch from the former to the latter, but once you get over that syntactic difference it's not too hard to readapt. The labs and quizzes were super easy, and the written homework (most of which you can have a partner for) was definitely doable –– just don't put them off until the last minute (they take hours) and absolutely go to OH if you need help. All of the TAs were super helpful and accessible. As for the final project, you essentially determine the difficulty yourself, so don't give yourself something too terrible and you should be fine. Same as the written, though, give yourself an excess of time –– my partner and I were still working on it on the due date even after we'd given ourselves a lot of time, so I'd say better safe than sorry.<br><br>The grading breakdown for this quarter was:<br><br>What	                Value	When	        Count<br>Homework assignments	65.0%	Tuesdays	6<br>Lab quizzes            	5.0%	Sundays	        8<br>Final project prose	4.5%	Thursdays	3<br>Final project code	25.5%	March 9th	1<br><br>I'm assuming this is subject to change, but it'll probably be similar in the future.</td>

The homeworks are much harder, and C/C++ are just more difficult languages that do not baby you in any way. Working in a linux PC was also a huge pain use, but all of it will be useful later. Just be ready to experience a lot more errors. Luckily there was a very lenient late policy, without which the class would be nearly impossible.</td>

You will likely spend a LOT of time on the class (I probably spent 20+ hours a week on everything because of the lectures etc. and just spend a chunk of hours doing debugging etc), but it is SO FUN (if you like programming) and it does SUCH a good job immersing you in the language. I feel like I picked up so much C and C++ because they just immerse you in the language. Jesse and Branden are awesome professors, and the subject matter of the class is really interesting and fun. Some of the homework can get pretty hard at times, but if you're taking the class you're likely a CS major and enjoy debugging and programming. In which case you'll probably love the class. it's mostly just focused on practice through the homework– and lectures etc. and I feel like it is an AMAZING class. You don't need to have taken anything other than 111 beforehand– some hw is tricky but it's really fun too and it's definitely not super hard.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_76389db6-41e6-4091-b26a-78b40356017c">No beating around the bush this class is very hard. If you would like to be intellectually challenged in a CS class, you find yourself in the right spot here. It is also a very forgiving class all things considered. You will learn most of your skills in the pre recorded lectures, and build upon those with practice and questions during class time. Assignments are also very forgiving with late credit, so if you need to take an extra day to turn a 90% to a 100% assignment, it would be in your best interest. Last thing: ASK FOR HELP. The most unwise thing to do, is to go at this class alone. You will need to go to office hours. Most assignments allow partners, take advantage of that. This class is hard enough as it is, there is no reason to make it worse on yourself.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_76389db6-41e6-4091-b26a-78b40356017c">The course is challenging in the way of figuring out what is wanted from you in homeworks. The deciphering of what instructors meant in the PDF takes the biggest amount of time. Other than that, it is a straightforward programming class and does not pose any hard problems for one to solve. Another difficulty is that coming up with tests for your own programs is not easy. As always, the number of bugs you unintentionally make can increase the hours you spend on an assignment from 5 to infinity, so working with a partner is key for success in this class.</td>

I really wish we focused a lot more on C++ rather than spending over half of the quarter with C. The main hits to my grade were from self–evaluations, where if you didn't predict which test cases would show up, even if you had perfect code, your assignment would score anywhere between an 80% to a 90%. I found that rather unfair. Other than that, the C++ portion of the class was good and I liked how we had a lot of flexibility to code whatever we wanted for the final project.</td>

The homework assignments start decently easy (the first two), get hard (3), then get SUPER hard (4 and 6) with another pretty hard one (5). You do the first 4 in C, and like most of the class, it kinda feels like you have to teach yourself all of the material. 3 gets hard because you'll get endless errors, and 4 just feels nearly impossible. Then you make a seriously abrupt switch to C++, which is generally a more user–friendly language, but you're taught nearly nothing about it. This makes homework 5 kind of tricky because your teaching yourself a new–ish language, then homework 6 gets even harder just because of some hard algorithms you have to write and tricky UI implementation. The final project is essentially any game you want it to be. You have to tell them 10–12 things your game will do (functional requirements), and that counts for about 60% of your final project grade. Overall, the work load in this class is incredibly high and pretty tough. I turned in 4/6 assignments late, and 2 of them over a week late. THIS IS OKAY THOUGH!!!!<br><br>Because Jesse and Branden are super understanding. This was what made the class manageable. Jesse and Branden are great and super helpful, even if sometimes live lectures got pretty in the weeds, they were mostly just office hours basically. The grading in this class is AMAZING! Every day your late is only 1% of your homework assignment, which lets you turn things in, see how well you do with the autograder, then resubmit as much as you want. There are also office hours every day with very helpful TAs. I think these aspects almost make up for the difficulty of the work.<br><br>If you're taking this class it's probably not a question of if but when, so no one is probably reading this like oh wow maybe I'll take it now. I just appreciate details about classes so here you go</td>

I struggled so much it was painful. If I could go back I would take 150 and 214 beforehand so I would be more prepared. If you have a background in C or object oriented programming you can go from 111 to 211 but if you do not, you will struggle. It is a tough class and goes by quick. Tov and Ghena are great professors but if you fall back one week, you are in for a ride and painful, endless night. Do not overcomplicate your final project, when you can not finish it, it will hurt so much that you gave yourself something excruciating to do. Recommend to take this with other people to rely on help, going alone into it will be difficult and a lot of hours in office hours.

Lecture recordings were always posted before class days, and class periods were usually spent as demo and Q&amp;A times. There would also be coding labs to help you learn concepts, which would be followed by short quizzes. Half of the quarter was spent learning C, while the other half was C++, so if you feel like you are struggling at the beginning, know that it gets much better! My biggest piece of advice would be to try to start your homework as soon as possible so you can go into office hours when you have questions. The late work policy is extremely flexible, so do not feel overwhelmed if your tests are failing near the due date! Overall, despite the challenge, I feel like I have learned a lot in this course.</td>

Coming into this class, I didn't really have experience beyond programming single file code. I learned a lot regarding how to work with larger projects and seeing how the compiler interprets the code I write. Sometimes it was easy to forget that everyone in the class was a beginner to the concepts, but office hours with TAs/PMs and the professors were always very accessible.

If you are coming into this class with a good understanding of C, you will probably breeze through this class just fine.

The profs try to make this class challenging but they did not have to do us like this. It is also demoralizing when you know other people are finished in a couple hours while you take days to finish the homeworks. Definitely go to TA office hours. I'd also say Jesse's office hours are better than Branden's, but take that with a grain of salt. <br><br>The first half of the class is in C and the second half is in C++. There are videos to watch before lecture, but it got to the point I think most people stopped watching them. But at least watch until you cover the basics of C++. The profs used lectures to demonstrate principles covered in the videos. Only a third of class showed up as the quarter went on. I'm just saying it as it is. <br><br>The hw's get harder as you go in my opinion. HW1 and 5 are individual. HW1 should not be hard. HW4 is the last homework in C and it's pretty difficult. Then you move on to C++ to make games. I'd say HW5 and HW6 were extremely difficult and wrecked my morale. Good thing is you only get 1% deduction for every day late. You have to guess which tests they'll ask in the self evaluations which was annoying. <br><br>The final project you have to make a game from scratch –– they don't give you anything. I'm pretty salty as I write this right now because the final project is just so time consuming. Part of it is probably that it's winter quarter and we're still online. The homeworks were hard enough idk why they feel the need to load us with a final project. This class just disregards the fact you have other classes. Get a good partner or AT LEAST a hard working one because you will be spending a lot of time working on this class. <br><br>If I had to say one good thing about this class, it's that it makes you learn C and C++. You only have a couple weeks for both languages but the assignments make you understand the languages better and makes you better at programming. this class broke me and built me up as a programmer.<br><br>TLDR big Spain without the S.</td>

This class's assignments are mostly partner–based, so find a good partner and set up a good schedule and dedicate time and crank out each homework and GO TO OFFICE HOURS and you should be good. Also the course's late policy is super forgiving – only 1% off each day it's late, so you're encouraged to complete the homeworks thoroughly even if they're late. You can get super behind in everything and still end up ok, so stick through it and you'll come out on the other side.

Especially after the anti–cheating presentation that scared me from talking to anyone else. I would spend several days and hours each day trying to work through homeworks and keeping up with lectures and by mid–quarter I was burnt out. Every night this quarter, I would dedicate myself just to the homework assignments from my last class at 6PM to midnight which also hindered my progress in other classes so do not take this class alongside other heavy courses.

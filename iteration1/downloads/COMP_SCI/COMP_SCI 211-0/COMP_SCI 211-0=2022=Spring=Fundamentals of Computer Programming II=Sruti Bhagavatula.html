It's a great class for learning C/C++ but only if you're committed to making to through the class with an A. You will not get help in office hours so pick your partner well. Also, professor and TAs were defensive and combative when a student tried to address the issues with office hours. Treat this class as a very self–reliant course.</td>

Pro–tip, please start your projects as soon as they are released. Do not wait just because you have 2 weeks, trust me, you need these two weeks. In general, start your assignments early and make good use of office hours. Most TAs are really good at spotting errors that you may have overlooked and are nice enough to walk you through them. A big shout out to Dilan Nair. Go to his office hours; you will not regret it. He actually takes the time to understand your code and tries to pinpoint the error and most times, if not all times, if you fix that error, your code works. Professor Bhagavatula is a sweet individual. The difficulty of the class may sometimes overshadow that but she is frank about the difficulty of each assignment throughout the quarter. Overall, she is an attentive teacher and will make sure that her students feel comfortable enough in class to ask questions either by raising their hands or anonymously asking via campuswire. Her quizzes are really simple; if you actually attend class. So please, do not be deceived she is a great teacher, the content of the class is difficult either way.</td>

There are 6 weekly assignments, most of which you can do with a partner (i highly recommend that you do, and choose your partner wisely). There are also 3 or 4 quizzes and a final project. On its own, this class is manageable; if you're like me and want to double up, it *can* be doubled with 214, but if you double it your other class(es) must be VERY easy. Office hours are essential in this class, and you need to sign up as fast as possible when they start; later in the quarter, it was quite normal to wait 1.5 to 2 hours for a TA to meet with you, as the homeworks grew more difficult and time consuming. I recommend you use your free late days (you get three) on your 4th assignment, and try to save one or two for the last two assignments, which are in C++. they say those are easier than the hardest C assignment, and they are in some ways, but they require you to learn some new syntax and it can be tough to get used to.</td>

The professor wasted a lot of time in lectures for administrative work and "live coding" and skimmed over important content. The assignments were not as difficult in execution as they were in trying to decipher what you are meant to do. I sincerely hope the assignments are restructured because they don't really test your grasp over the concepts covered in class or help you build familiarity with the languages. At the very least, I hope the specifications for the assignments are rewritten, because I spent more time trying to figure them out than I would have liked to. The project was fine.</td>

Some ways to make the most out of your CS211 experience include going to class, going to office hours, and getting a partner for your HW assignments (STRONGLY recommend this). While there were some decently challenging aspects of this class, I came out of this class becoming a better programmer. Sruti really emphasizes writing tests and debugging code in this class because C (and C++ to a lesser extent) is a low–level language where there are some really weird errors. Overall, I hope to take the skills from CS211 forward to my future CS classes, and I honestly wouldn't worry too much if you get help and START EARLY.</td>

The homework assignments can be pretty difficult so make sure to start early and go to office hours. There are definitely enough resources in this class to be able to easily get an A, but you'll be putting a lot of time into this course, as homeworks will take a while. Make sure you have a good partner for the homeworks!! There's 4 quizzes which are easy if you pay attention to lectures but they aren't worth much of your grade. You get two weeks at the end of the quarter to work on your final project which is probably the hardest part of the class, but definitely not extremely difficult. Overall good class and Shruti is a great professor.</td>

I enjoyed this class much more than CS111 because of the language switch, and knowing what everyone says when defending CS111 and Racket, I feel that CS211 has been so much more useful to me in improving my programming knowledge and abilities than 111 was. Prof. Sruti did an overall good job with her lectures and I always felt that lectures did a solid job of teaching us the fundamentals that would be used and expanded upon as we did our weekly homework. The weekly homework never felt like too much for one week, but I highly encourage you start the homework early because you will spend a LOT of time debugging, especially during the C weeks with memory management and pointers. The TAs are super useful and always did their best to help me out in my experience, so I also encourage people to go the the office hours with homework.</td>

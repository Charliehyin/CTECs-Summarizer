Professor Hummel has done a wonderful job condensing the fundamental parts of C &amp; C++ into a 9 week long course, and I think I've come out of this class with a solid foundation in both languages despite having no prior experience in either beforehand. The weekly projects may seem brutal, but they are incredibly effective at further instilling the concepts you learn in class, and I found that they got significantly easier as the course progressed and my understanding of the content grew. If you commit to starting the homework and projects early, the workload should not be a problem: office hours and Piazza were also very helpful whenever I had questions. Pointers, references, and memory management in particular are all covered in the curriculum. As long as you take it seriously, this class is well worth the effort.</td>

Weekly projects started off extremely difficult (I think I'm fairly decent at programming and I had more a background) but the projects for the first few weeks legitimately took me 8–12 hours to do every time. C is a pretty frustrating language but if you can get past the first few weeks the rest of the course is not a problem at all. The only problem is the time spent – your actual grade is guaranteed to be quite good if you are able to do the projects and homework. There is a final exam but it is very easy.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_d648c630-a093-44a5-97da-d10f366a7dd7">This course teaches a lot of great things but at the fault of being WAY TOO MUCH. I know this is Professor Hummel’s first quarter and he wants us to learn but he did not take into account that the majority of students are in McCormick and already have a huge course load, separate from this course. I think this course would have been a lot more reasonable if the projects focused on a smaller scope of concepts and was not so vague in some of the instructions. This course required a lot of background knowledge on how to problem solve that I do not think a lot of students acquired that should have been taught more in–depth in class. Don’t get me wrong, I did learn a lot but this class was unnecessarily stressful and took so much time and effort. Every week I would be stressing about the next project. I also believe it to be extremely unreasonable to have the projects due on a Friday since many students do not have time during the week to begin. It also caused many of the PM’s to be extremely overworked on Friday night, which is unfair to them and to us. No project should be due on Friday’s much less if the instructor does not release it until Saturday or Sunday. I am in disbelief that Professor Hummel would not give us at least a week to complete projects and he should have extended this deadline a week after he released the materials. I understand his argument of “small penalties” but many of us McCormick students are perfectionists and do not want to sacrifice a couple points, causing us to unnecessarily stress out and be overworked. I think making a project due at least a week after it’s released is the bare minimum. Besides Professor Hummel’s negligence of this extraneous workload, he is a good instructor who teaches CS in an effective method. The replit in–class participation were helpful in learning how to approach the language and his lectures were very helpful. I also appreciate him answering questions during class and on piazza. He is also very helpful during office hours and effectively answers students questions. Obviously, Professor Hummel needs to get settled and acknowledge what is reasonable for NU students and what is not. I believe that if he internalizes these criticisms and works to balance his course better, it will be one of the most effective CS courses at NU.</td>

Definitely felt like a rough draft but it's still my favorite class I've taken here so far. I really like lower–level/systems programming (I'm CompE) and I learned so much about C, C++, and how computers work in general through this class. The first few projects were kind of out of the scope of this class, and way over my head (my only previous programming experience was 111) tho so I'm prolly not getting an A :(.<br>Hummel is a great lecturer and his slides are great, he's super knowledgeable and his lectures are very engaging. He's not the most approachable with questions though, and if you email him (instead of posting on Piazza) he wont be happy lol.<br>The grading is 8 weekly projects (48%), weekly homework (18%), in–class participation (12%), and a final (22%). Start the projects early and go to office hours, you'll probably have questions and might even be completely lost on some (projects 1&amp;3).</td>

Hummel did not do a good job in preparing his students for the projects and often left us feeling very hopeless in completing these assignments. The first two projects were unreasonable at best, and even meeting with PMs and going to office hours were not that helpful because they were always so overwhelmed with students. The lectures were a little messy and difficult to follow if you did not have prior knowledge in C/C++, and Hummel was honestly pretty unforgiving with that. There was no consideration to the learning curve nor did there seem to be care for student well–being.</td>

I wasn't expecting the same class because I knew it was a new professor but what we got was much worse then what I expected.  For an intro to C/C++ class the projects we were working on were very complicated and the the turn around on projects was very quick.  Professor Hummel was fair about the late penalty which was nice but to be given a project on Monday and have 10–20 hours of coding to do depending on the project can be a lot.  Also the material we needed to know for the projects was much more complicated then what we were taught in class which made the projects even more difficult.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_d648c630-a093-44a5-97da-d10f366a7dd7">This class was quite a train wreck, especially toward the beginning of the quarter. Hummel was a new professor this quarter and the 211 curriculum was completely redesigned. From what I've heard, the class prior to this quarter was a semi–collaborative environment where there was usually one project due each week. This quarter however, there was both a weekly project and a weekly homework assignment, both meant to be extremely individual.<br><br>I'm unsure how many people drop out of this class regularly, but this quarter, after the first project, there seemed to be a very high number of drop outs. This was probably due to the fact that the first project was absurdly long and time consuming. In the project description, Hummel had estimated that the project would take 10 hours, which is already a large time commitment for one weekly project on top of another weekly homework assignment. In my experience, the project ended up taking most people at least 12 hours.<br><br>For either the second or third project, he upped the time estimation for the project to 12 hours. Then, I'm sure after many frantic emails and complaints about how long projects were taking, Hummel just stopped putting these time estimations on the projects altogether, which seemed like a deflection of his responsibility to curate a reasonable project. If you weren't given the right direction by a PM or the like, there were times where you might code for hours only to realize your first attempt at implementing the program was wholly incorrect.<br><br>Overall, Hummel's lectures were fine. They usually got the message across through slides and coding demonstrations. The sheer amount of work required for this class was just a bit wild. Expecting students to devote something like 14 hours a week plus 3 hours of lectures to an INTRODUCTORY programming class, and also manage 3 or 4 other classes was a bit inconsiderate. <br><br>It was especially frustrating because it became very clear that the pace of the course was too fast for the vast majority of students: he would frequently extend deadlines simply because there weren't enough students submitting successful programs or just programs period. When this happened with the first project, he sent quite a passive aggressive email to the students, saying things like (and these are direct quotes), "As often happens, folks underestimate the time it takes to learn a new language," and "Your supportive staff is going to extend project 01 for 24 hours", and "Extensions will not be forth–coming in projects 02 and beyond except for extreme circumstances. Whenever you work with new technologies, you have to expect things to take longer, sometimes much longer." Spoiler alert: extensions and "extreme circumstances" occurred many times over the rest of the quarter.<br><br>This is not to say Hummel was a bad professor. He was clearly very interested and knowledgable in the area. He just simply refused to take any responsibility for the fact that perhaps his first attempt at restructuring an entire pre–existing curriculum, at a university he was new to, was unsuccessful.<br><br>I do have to give a HUGE shoutout to the PM's, though. Based on the office hours I went to, all the PM's were saviors. Project setup was a very difficult task without their involvement. Because of the sheer volume of people at some office hours, PM's would very often stay after their allotted time just to help. I recently found out that there is something like a 6 hour cap on working hours for PM's as well as some limited overtime, so I know for a fact that some of the PM's were working without pay to help with the flood of confused and frustrated students.<br><br>I expect that many of these issues will be resolved by next quarter, so don't fear too much :) .</td>

It was apparent that Hummel was making them as he went.<br><br>HOWEVER, I really liked the course. Hummel is a great lecturer and super knowledgable. The projects are ambitious but doable if you get help from PM's (which have OH every day). I feel like I learned A LOT in this class.

Whilst I do speak from a biased standpoint, relatively proficient to adjacent programming languages and having basic knowledge of memory before the course, Hummel taught this course particularly wonderfully.

A lot of the things he covered in class were incredibly straightforward once he explained them, and that definitely made this class bearable. That being said, other aspects of this class weren't as straightforward for me, mainly the projects and office hours at the beginning of the quarter. Nearly half of the class was completed in Replit. It hid certain issues and errors that gradescope does check for, and thus made it a lot more difficult to figure out what the actual issue was when the output looked exactly the same. <br>The office hours were also pretty bad for the first half of the quarter.

I do not think I have seen a single question on Piazza go unanswered for longer than a few hours, and the listed average response time is 10 minutes. He has a different approach towards assignments and projects than the other professors, but I found them all to be worthwhile and interesting applications of C and C++. There are supposed to be 10 homework assignments (all infinite submissions) and 8 projects (7 with infinite submissions, 1 with 8 submissions) spread out evenly over the 10 weeks, but in practice Professor Hummel is still fine–tuning and adapting the course for the quarter system.

I think that Prof. Hummel came into the class expecting the students to know much more information than the level that many students at in CS for CS 211. I found myself incredibly stressed the first few weeks as the projects were incredibly difficult to understand and write with the help of TAs or Prof. Hummel. The instructions that Prof. Hummel writes are lengthy and at times unclear of what steps exactly need to be completed. Along with this, I think that I did not have a clear understanding of what the projects were doing as I did not have any background in SQL and Prof. Hummel had not explained it clearly. Also, for the first project I distinctly remember that the project felt like a tedious assignment more than anything as it involved writing so many if statements with the purpose of showing us in later projects how this tedious way of writing programming can be eliminated. I spent many hours on CS 211 (most likely up to 15 – 20 hours a week) trying to finish projects that I had started at the beginning of the week. I think Prof. Hummel is very patient with students and he is very helpful during office hours, but I do think that the way that he designed CS 211 was deeply flawed. I was grateful that halfway through the quarter he dialed back the work as he realized it was not a possible workload to manage.</td>

I understand that he is a relatively new professor and may not have a good grasp on the students' abilities, but I've seen explicit messages from him completely disregarding the peer mentors' concerns with the difficulty of the course, so I don't think being new is an excuse for his unwillingness to accommodate students better. Grades were not inputted until after the drop and withdrawal deadlines, but even before that the drop rate of the class was already 15%, which should be evidence that there is an issue in of itself. There is a project due every week and these are not measly assignments that most people can get done in a few hours. The content he goes over in class is informative, but not nearly enough to understand how to complete the projects without extensive help from PAs, which I can imagine is exhausting for them as well. He initially included "estimated time of completion" for the projects, which usually spanned from 5 to 10 hours on average, but actually turned out to be very inaccurate as I would say the average student spends at least twice that time and mostly more. Each assignment builds on the previous, so you essentially become more and more lost as the quarter progresses because his lectures cannot cover everything for the projects. I would say he isn't a bad lecturer––Hummel is very articulate and knowledgeable––but his expectations were far too high for mostly freshman students who only took 111 (Racket) and maybe 150 (python).

He is extremely knowledgable about the content and is a very caring and dedicated instructor. He answered my questions patiently and very insightfully, and he is very responsive on Piazza. <br>– Contrary to what some people may claim, this class is actually very easy to do well in. If you put in the effort to work on the program methodically, and go to office hours if you need help (Hummel basically walks you through the solution), there is no reason why you shouldn't get 100% in every project. About 80–90% of all students eventually get a 100% on the project, so that tells you that doing well is entirely possible. People mainly complain because projects take a long time (more on that below), but this isn't CS 111 or 150 anymore so you just need to get used to it. If you struggle in this class, just take it again in a lighter quarter.<br>– Grading is very reasonable. You can run your code an unlimited number of times on Gradescope (except for the last project), late policy is very lenient (2% deducted every 12 hours) and the final exam was very fair and similar to the practice final.<br>– Lectures are engaging, which is partly because Hummel is a great guy with good vibes that you just want to listen to him, and partly thanks to the in–class coding exercises that give you some hands on experience with the C and C++ concepts covered. <br><br>CONS<br>– The first few projects in C were a lot of work, even for someone with C experience. Weekly projects took anywhere from 4 to 16 hours (24 for some of my friends. I think Hummel didn't realize how long some of his projects were, but he definitely corrected that in the second half of the class by making the projects shorter. For future iterations of this class, I'm sure projects will be more reasonably paced and manageable.<br>– The second half of the class can be disorganized at times. Because C++ is such a complicated language, it sometimes felt like Hummel was just bouncing different topics without a clear progression.<br>– You have to pay for an online textbook called Zybooks, which were kind of useful but we didn't use them much in the C++ half of the class.<br>– Much of the content rehashes things you'll learn in CS 214 (like graphs and Dijkstra's algorithm), but that might be a benefit if you're taking 214 at the same time.</td>

However, I think Prof. Hummel did a really good job of teaching key concepts in C/C++ and leading in to further CS courses (namely 214). Some projects took a disproportionate amount of time and the instructions were very restrictive – i.e. it was less applying knowledge from class and more just learning how to follow steps. But definitely doable although the first four projects were brutal. It's easy to do very well in this class since all projects are auto graded and the final exam is very fair.

He's an amazing professor with his teaching and I really felt I learned a lot.  With that being said, some of the projects took FOREVER.  There were weekly projects that we had and I'd say I probably spent an average of 8–10 hours a week on them.  They were difficult for various reasons, but if I could change one thing it would be the time the projects would take.  The grading is pretty nice overall and his late policy is amazing (2% for every 12 hours with max of 8%).  I learned a lot about C and C++ and it really opened my eyes to the inner workings of programming languages since C is such low level.  He records lectures and has great slides.  Overall the class has with Hummel has so many amazing aspects if I ignore how difficult some of the projects were.</td>

As someone with some prior experience in CS from high school and the first two into CS classes here, CS 211 by far my favorite. It was challenging but intellectually fulfilling. I could see myself improving and Hummel’s lectures were also great. He’s VERY responsive on Piazza and there are hella office hours hosted by Hummel and the PMs for this class. Even though the projects take a while, if you go to office hours, you’re going to get them done.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_d648c630-a093-44a5-97da-d10f366a7dd7">beginning of the quarter was rough. First couple of projects were poorly designed, Prof Joe's time estimate for the project was way under how long it actually took, and I wouldn't have been able to do it if I hadn't done it all in PM office hours because we hadn't learned the necessary basics for coding in C regarding things like syntax. That being said some of the PMs were incredible and I learned a lot from them. The rest of the quarter was better. Lectures were not very engaging and Prof Joe's diagramming is a bit messy but he did post the lecture recordings so it's easy to go back and review. I thought the section of C++ was taught better than C. After this course I cannot confidently say that I could explain pointers or malloc well, which is a little worrisome considering that a good understanding of C is necessary for 213. Also 214 should 100% be a prerequisite for this course because literally like half of what we learned this quarter was about data structures in C and C++ and the final project had time and space complexity requirements for our implementation. Mind you, the professor took about 2 minutes during one lecture to *attempt* to explain what bigO is and how complexity works, but without the context from 214 it would have made no sense to me and the class overall would have been much harder to understand. Overall I have mixed feelings about the course because the Professor is actually very kind, responsive on Piazza, and it's very clear that he wants us to learn and do well, but he's just not a great lecturer and the material could be conveyed in a much clearer manner. Also the final exam was not bad at all.</td>

Don't get me wrong –– Hummel is a really great guy, but this course felt disorganized and like more a lot more thought could have been put into it.</td>

He redesigned the course and implemented new projects. Admittedly, the first couple were maybe too hard. But definitely doable. He's one of the nicest and most understanding teachers I've ever had. If you go to his office hours you will get help and he will make sure you understand what's going on. He had about 8 office hours per week, which was more than I've had for other classes.<br><br>I'd go to most of his office hours to work on my projects and really enjoyed the course. All of the people I know who struggled and complained about the class would start the projects a day before they're due and make 0 effort to seek help. Would recommend taking with him. He's also very receptive to feedback and indicated that he's going to continue tweaking the course going forward.</td>

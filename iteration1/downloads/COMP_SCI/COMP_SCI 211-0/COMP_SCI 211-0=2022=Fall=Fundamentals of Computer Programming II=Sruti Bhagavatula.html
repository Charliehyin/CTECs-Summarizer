I found it super useful to learn both C and C++, and doing so didn't feel at all rushed. There was plenty of time to complete homework assignments and lots of office hours, which I greatly appreciated. Also, the homework assignments closely correspond to what you learn in lecture and the lectures contain lots of coding examples, which I think is one of the best formats for a CS class.</td>

A tip for office hours that you'll learn later is to sign up for the sessions as soon as they open so you can get help right away, or else you might be waiting 30+ minutes for PMs to get to you. The quizzes are very easy and not too in depth on the subject.</td>

Homeworks, as long as you start early enough, read the documentation/comments all the way through, and understand the class concepts in general, are very doable. They are time consuming, but not incredibly difficult.  Note that writing tests for your code will take a LONG TIME, much more than it takes to write the actual code. In class quizzes are pretty much a breeze as long as you understand the class concepts in a general sense.</td>

The sooner the more help you can get especially since office hours become packed the last few days. The final project is really fun but definitely start as soon as possible to prevent any stressful situations. There are 5 late day passes so use them wisely.

Some of the homeworks build on each other and can get really complex, so this class is more of a time commitment as the quarter goes on.

But, when we started learning C++, the teaching got worse and the concepts were not really explained in detail. The Professor made it seem like C and C++ was similar, but in my experience, the shift was not very smooth in between the two languages as the HW assignments were nothing alike.</td>

However, I had never officially learned C before I started embedded programming. If you for any reason think that you might have interest in embedded programming (programming of microcontrollers, motor control, etc.), I would definitely take this class, even if you aren't a Comp Sci minor or major. It ehances your knowledge of the language, which in turn will make you better at optimizing memory usage in situations where you are actually constrained (microcontrollers often have very little memory). If you are a comp–sci minor or major... you have to take this class anyway, so I would recommend taking it with professor Hummel.</td>

The first half is in C, which is a little difficult to get through, but the C++ half is quite similar to Java, and was much more familiar to me personally. I would recommend starting on homeworks as early as possible, as office hours are almost a waste of time near due dates.</td>

Concepts can be hard to follow along in lectures because they really won't make much sense until you actually apply them in HW projects.

We spent a long time on memory allocation and failed to cover some more important topics. I took the class primarily because I was interested in game design and wanted to learn C++. Multiple homeworks and the final project were dedicated to coding games, which I appreciated. That said, they required a lot of time in and out of class to learn the NU CS211 game engine. I wouldn’t feel confident coding a game in C++ without of the ge211 engine.</td>

I went into this course with a lot of C/C++ knowledge, and even then the class was a hefty amount of work. Programming assignments were extremely laborious because you essentially have to guess which test cases you will be graded on for each assignment, often times resulting in just as much time writing random test cases as the actual assignment itself. I'm not sure how other professors decide on grading test cases, however I would go so far as to say that you should take this class with a different professor if you know they aren't as strict with them. It was deeply frustrating to lose upwards of 10% on an assignment because you didn't guess to implement frankly arbitrary test cases. Besides that, however, Professor Sruti does a good job of covering a broad range of topics fundamental to C and C++, and any criticism that can be made of course pacing is probably better directed at the quarter system than her.</td>

I didn't have too hard of a time with the homework, but some of it was rather difficult because C kinda sucks sometimes and not everything is explained well in lecture. Sruti is a new professor and it shows in the lectures. They are really hard to listen to sometimes. She will spend 10 minutes talking about for loops and while loops, basically saying the same sentences over and over (just worded a little differently), then zoom through a completely new concept. Her live coding demos are also hard to follow along because she types real fast and it can be hard to keep up. Especially because if you copy something wrong you can get errors that you then have to debug, while she sprints ahead. I recommend just downloading the final code afterwards and taking a look over that instead of trying to follow along live.</td>

Any reproduction, republication or redistribution of this site's content is prohibited without the express permission of Northwestern University.<br><br>In the last two weeks of Winter Quarter 2020, students were strongly encouraged and subsequently required to leave campus as a result of a public health emergency. Faculty redesigned and rescheduled final assessments, in some cases overnight. As a result,&nbsp;CTEC&nbsp;response rates may be lower, and quantitative feedback may be less robust or may reflect the turmoil of the time.<br><br>For more information about the CTEC Guidelines please visit our website: <a href="http://www.northwestern.edu/ctec/guidelines/index.html">http://www.northwestern.edu/ctec/guidelines/index.html</a><br>&nbsp;</span>

It's an excellent introduction to C and C++ and Jesse was a pretty good instructor. Don't listen to the rumors, he's actually very good at teaching this class in my opinion. The first half of the course especially is really vital. There is a lot that he teaches about memory allocation and pointers that are super super important to know. Make sure you have a great partner for the homework programs!! That will make or break your grade. The exams are pretty difficult, but study hard and you should be fine.</td>

I'd heard a lot of bad things about Jesse going in, but I thought he was a better teacher than people give him credit for. Yes, he sometimes struggles to explain things, but he clearly knows a TON about programming, C, and C++, and he's very interested in these topics. The homework assignments and final project, which make up most of the grade, were challenging, but they were also rewarding when I finished them, and I think they really helped me learn. Having a partner for most of them was also nice.</td>

Learned a lot from the homework and projects, but the lectures are confusing, and exams seem to be pretty far away from what I actually learned / thought I need to learn. Details of programming can definitely be explained better ––– instead of showing a lot of exceptions, focusing on hammering down what's essential for our understanding of C / C++</td>

First of all, I would try not to get too psyched out by reading the CTECs before taking it.  I know it has a reputation, but I feel like it's exaggerated too much.  At times it feels like he's throwing you into the deep end, but he does that on purpose.  You learn to figure things out, and become a better programmer in the process.  I would recommend just taking this class as soon as you can, and not worry about who's teaching it too much.  However, try to get a solid partner because most of the HWs are partner projects.</td>

I got through it because I got a  senior CS major to sit down with me and answer all my questions and teach me how to write code. You do not get taught how to code in the languages you just get thrown and have to spend hours googling things to get the semantics right. I had no prior coding experience besides 111 and this class was extremely difficult.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_89038610-8a04-462f-ba74-6660fbbd4cdc">This class was something special. Where to even begin. My conclusion is that the class was pretty good, but it was also a black hole that sucked all of my time and forced me to drop one of my other classes. The homework often took quite a long time to do, but many times, the test cases took even longer. Because a significant part of your homework grade depends on whether you wrote certain test cases, I spent so much time making sure every possibility was covered, even if I was 100% confident the code was perfectly functional. This may have taken more time than writing the original programs because I had to come up with testing situations and tediously implement them, not just verify things work by running it normally. Maybe that's a good skill to have though. But the homework overall just took so much, even with the help of a competent partner. The due dates did keep getting pushed back a bit, which might been nice, but it also squeezed our final project. The final project was interesting and more fulfilling once we finished it, but there was still some testing and other aspects that were annoying. Overall, it definitely made me do a lot of coding and debugging, though I feel much more comfortable with C++ than C. Part of that is just that I had no idea what was going on with C and did not understand a lot of the things used, while C++ is much more straightforward, normal looking, and with a much more usable editor that did what I expected and did not do what I did not expect.<br><br>Jessie himself is nice and he definitely put in a lot of time for us and the class. he was always answering questions on Campuswire, very quickly and thoroughly. He also spent a lot of time making tests to run on our code before they were due, so that we could see if anything went wrong and make revisions. I really appreciate all the work and effort he put into the class, as it was clear that he tried his best to help us. In the end, I did learn a lot, but maybe more about coding than the C/C++ information taught by the class. The lectures were a bit messy and hard to understand at times, especially with code changes on the fly and people asking questions that go in many directions (although sometimes they result in answers that might not have otherwise been said). There were definitely a lot of things that I did not get from the lectures and remained confused about for a long time (even now), especially some of the notation, concepts, uses, etc of things like pointers, references, classes, and whatnot. His tests were very hard, especially without a full grasp on the information. He graded them very quickly though, and they are not worth too too much. I also did not take the optional second exam (probably about half did), but that was just due to an odd situation with the virus.<br><br>Overall, while the lectures were not amazing and the tutorials had a huge amount of variance in how good they were, Jessie did his best to teach us, and in the end, I think he did. Just in an interesting way that required a lot of time and effort, a lot of confusion, but also a lot of coding and getting good at that. C and C++ have so much content and are confusing, so maybe it's no wonder I was confused, and I can't really blame Jessie for that. Like I said, it's a class that's challenging and takes a lot of time, but it was pretty good, and I can code now.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_89038610-8a04-462f-ba74-6660fbbd4cdc">The course is structured to teach both C and C++ in one quarter. The first quarter is extremely challenging dealing with dynamic memory management while developing in C. It's challenging for everyone in the class including some with years of experience programming. But each time you complete an assignment you feel you have learnt enough to drop out and begin your PhD studies in fundamentals of programming if that is even a thing. The difficulty appears to reduce substantially after your first midterm when you switch to C++ although that is not true. The class maintains its level of difficulty expect of course the concepts covered are not completely alien to almost everyone in the class. Overally when you end the class you realize you know nothing about programming from the way the instructor touches on different concepts but at least you enjoy being in the class. Its the only class with over 150 people at least and you still get to know at least more than half as you work on your assignments together in pairs.</td>

The main positives I can give about the class is that the assignments, although difficult, were genuinely helpful for actually understanding what was discussed in lecture. The exams also usually felt fair, given that Tov was pretty upfront about the structure and what would be covered.  However, the faults of the course and the reasons why I found it remarkably frustrating was that the presentations/lectures were poorly structured and that the assignments were tedious if you didn't have a good partner (speaking from personal experience). Tov himself during lecture is specifically pretty poor at explaining ideas in a logical way for someone who doesn't already know them and at answering questions meaningfully. You'll definitely need to put in the effort outside of class to understand what's going on, and also hopefully make connections with other students/TAs who can be better at explaining concepts in a more down–to–earth manner.</td>

			<td class="TabularBody_LeftColumn" headers="comment-2_89038610-8a04-462f-ba74-6660fbbd4cdc">Overall, CS 211 is very, very, very challenging, but it's worth a struggle, especially if you are like me, all the coding experience you have is Racket. Don't take this class unless you are required to take it. Weekly homework might take up like 15+ hours if you are trying to cover all the test cases, and the homework instructions are also very confusing to understand at first. Jesse is incredibly knowledgeable, and he really cares a lot about his students. He would reply to people's questions on campuswire very late at night, and he tried to reply as detailed as he can. But his lecture... honestly it is quite hard to follow –– sometimes you spaced out for like a minute and then you had no idea what he was talking about. His lecture is not very helpful with the homework but is what most of the problems on the midterms will be based on, so go to every lecture and at least try to understand part of it. This class is not as bad as what people wrote about for Winter 2019, at least now most of the TAs will be people who have taken this class before with Jesse so they know what's going on. Don't worry too much about the grading since most of it comes from the homework assignments. Get a good partner and hope your partner won't drop the class halfway through the quarter.</td>

It’s definitely harder than 111, but if you ask for help often (office hours, CampusWire discussion board, peers), you can get through it. Make sure to have a good partner, as you’ll have to go through a lot of debugging with them. For exams, make sure to learn the ins and outs of C syntax, as well as how constructors/destructors work for C++. If you’re newer to programming, then budget extra time to learn the basic syntax of C, since the class moves quickly in that regard. Also make sure to write robust test cases. The assignments can take a while, but they were interesting, and I found  it satisfying when I finally got them to work.</td>

On one hand, a lot of the original CTECS for this course with Jesse made note of his horrible style of lecturing ––silently live–coding entire programs in front of a whole lecture hall full of students with occasional explanation and side–commentary. This is something he did not begin to do until near the end of the course because he seemed to actually have lecture slides prepared that you could take notes off of. But by week 7 or 8, he definitely devolved into that previous manner of lecturing.<br><br>My biggest gripe with this course is that Jesse truly made his own job, and everyone elses, much more difficult than it needed to be, due to inefficiencies. To this day, I haven't figured out why his custom–coded grading site (GSC) is used as the administrative platform for all homework programs and exams when using Canvas, as every other professor does, works just as fine. In the first couple of weeks, he would also have to DEBUG his grading site, because it actually caused issues with some students trying to upload homework files. Another oddity that regularly occurred were the extensions we got on homework assignments –– there came a point where he would notify us on the external site he uses for asking any and all questions outside of class, Campus Wire, to let us know that we got a 24, 48..., etc hour extension. Except he would do this at midnight of the deadline. Or 2 am after the original deadline. or 4 am. For anyone who did not leave assignments till the last minute, this surprisingly began to anger you after the first couple of extensions, because there comes a point where when you run up against a deadline, you need to know when to quit and when to power through, and unfortunately you never knew this with Jesse and his randomly granted extensions.<br><br>Overall, while this course is being taken over by Jesse, a great deal of preparation could be done that would drastically improve this course in all aspects, and make it much more interesting and stimulating than it already is.</td>

He is a great resource that I am glad to have utilized frequently over the course of the quarter, and his expertise in the field really made sense there. The downside to these labs is Jesse's testing. If your implementation of a concept differs from how Jesse wants it to be implemented, even though it is functionally identical (e.g. including an extra space in a print statement accidentally, tracking a ball's collisions in Brick Out, or accounting for center–square moves in Reversi differently), it is counted as incorrect even though it is imperceptible from a user standpoint. The partner assignments in this class are also very hit–or–miss, and transferring code in between two computers is incredibly inefficient, and often redundant. It was rare that my partner and I both felt satisfied with the amount of work we put in to each assignment – there was no good way for us to split assignments up evenly and piece them back together, and partner programming at times was frustrating and ineffective. Midterms also felt very disjoint compared to the rest of the course, and came at very inconvenient times in the pacing of the labs. The first midterm was the week of Lab 4 (the lab which Jesse described to us as an "11/10" in terms of difficulty the first day), and the second one was two days before the intended due date of the final project.</td>

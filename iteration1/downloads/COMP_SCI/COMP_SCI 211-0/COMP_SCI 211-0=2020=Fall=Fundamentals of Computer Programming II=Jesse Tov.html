While it would certainly help to have prior experience in C/C++, it definitely isn't necessarily to succeed in this course, as they basically start from the ground up and make things approachable for beginners. Sometimes, I wish Professor Tov's lecture videos were a little bit more structured – at times, it can feel like he's jumping around a bit between disparate coding examples &amp; I think it would be good if he focused a little bit more on concrete concepts and theory. But overall, his teaching was pretty good &amp; he is clearly very knowledgeable about the subject (just go on CampusWire for questions and you will likely received a detailed response from him or one of the TAs). Despite what you may have heard from others, do not be intimidated to take this class. Just be willing to spend a little bit of time, and you will likely be fine.</td>

I don't think the asynchronous style molds very well to this class, as there are only a few videos to go off of per assignment, and the videos were overall somewhat limited and sometimes did not directly relate to the homework. The last homework assignment is particularly difficult, but the others are not terribly hard but require lots of work to complete on time and thoroughly. I spent a lot of time on this class because I procrastinated, and I feel bad for doing it, because it was very hard to dig myself out of the hole I dug myself into.</td>

I am fully aware that Professor Tov's previous CTECs criticize him for giving too much work, but having taken the COVID–reduced version I'm not too sure I believe the critics; the workload probably should have been increased (it seems there were technical issues with the grading system that lead to some long delays between assignments).</td>

The part of the class taught in C++ makes much more sense. Jesse seems to care a lot about his students, and was very kind in terms of extending deadlines, but sometimes the lectures went off–topic and explained things that weren't applicable at all, which could be confusing.</td>

The homework is mostly partner–based and presented somewhat confusingly, but it's reasonable. I went into the class with Java from AP Comp Sci, so the learning curve for C/C++ wasn't too steep, but I think if you only go into the class with 111 or 150, this class will be significantly harder.</td>

The coding assignments were pretty interesting and office hours (both students and Jesse) were extremely helpful for clarifying concepts and debugging code. Lectures were not helpful at all, although the videos Jesse made covered some important topics. Assignments did not come out on time (like not even close), but thankfully we got automatic extensions that were VERY lenient throughout the quarter. A wild experience for sure. I'm definitely more interested in CS though and C/C++ will come in handy so learn it well – just be prepared to do a LOT of learning on your own and HOURS of coding.</td>

It was difficult for me, with very little experience in computing. However, the material was very interesting, and once I put the time in to understand the concepts, the homework was very easy. Jesse changed the syllabus up due to some changes in how the quarter progressed, and I found the changes very beneficial and the flexibility provided was very helpful for me during this quarter. However, these changes were communicated very slowly, which I did not enjoy. I also would have preferred live lectures rather than recorded, like Jesse began to do towards the end.</td>

Jesse wants the course to be "hard" so he does not provide office hours and fails to respond to questions for days at a time. The actual work is not hard at all, but with no one teaching any relevant concepts and only huge long videos of live coding on a separate topic to help you, you will spend a lot of time on each homework. Office hours will often have only one/two students helped. Get a tutor if you need one. The course was frustrating. I often felt like I was being challenged on my Googling skills rather than learning. I've spent over 3 hours in office hours at a time only to not be helped. Having the videos released sporadically and only in huge hour chunks discouraged me from watching them. It was very overwhelming.</td>

At least Jesse didn't take it out on the students and gave us basically indefinite extensions on the homeworks and made the final project optional. Find a smart (or at least hardworking) partner and go to OH, or else the homeworks are a real struggle. Jesse and the TAs are always willing to help.</td>

There is a pretty big time commitment for anyone who does not come in familiar with C or C++ coding. Most of the time, I was doing self–learning by trying things out and failing over and over again. The assignments ask us to do things that we never learned how to do, which is very time–consuming and confusing. Be prepared to invest a lot of time into this class and be prepared to feel frustrated almost all of the time.</td>

The course was difficult in that if you've never programmed in C before, you can get a multitude of memory errors that just fill your screen with a wall of rainbow–colored text when you're trying to code. But that's just a part of coding. If you're very careful and do your best to truly understand the concepts that you are implementing, the class will be much easier.</td>

Be prepared to spend hours working on projects, and in office hours. Zoom CS office hours are pretty awful, however, and in my opinion unless you have prior experience in CS (I only took 111 before this class), you will need substantial help from office hours to be able to complete projects. Be prepared to wait for hours to get help. The TAs/peer mentors are great and try their best, but over zoom office hours are just so overcrowded that students can't get the amount of help they need to get projects completed.</td>

The lectures are very hard to follow and largely dive into tangential topics that are hard to truly connect to the homeworks. The class centers around ~weekly homework assignments that ranged from 10–20 hours of work for me. I personally had not gone to many office hours for other classes, but for this class it was a necessity in order to resolve issues with your code. Java experience helps. Clear up your schedule around this course and buckle up.</td>

Jesse is very flexible and lenient, but that means that it's up to you to keep on track of things. Especially during this period of online classes I think the better organized the professor is, the easier it is for the student to stay on top of things, but I appreciate how he was kind enough to accommodate for everyone.</td>

"I have a feeling like you'll need another day, let me give you an extension." He isn't scary, you just have to ask.

But although this class was definitely intimidating and time consuming, I finished feeling like I grew a lot as a programmer. The homework assignments were always challenging and pushed me to understand the new material and apply it and the spec both grew in complexity, but also gave less instruction as the course went on, which pushed me to problem solve quite a bit. The grading was always fair and Professor Tov always had his student's best interest at heart. Definitely a great class but very difficult and time consuming! I think I came out of this class as a better programmer but also with a better attitude about learning since it forced me out of my comfort zone quite a bit!</td>

A couple of weeks into the class, Prof. Tov canceled both synchronous lectures and discussion sections, and instead, posted lectures on Canvas, which were often late and came in bursts. There were only six grades in the entire class – the homework assignments. The final project was made optional because he did not get around to posting information about it on Canvas in time. He never set up an extension/late policy, so it was like there were no due dates. The TAs in office hours spent about 5 minutes per student, which was not helpful. The class was very disappointing after CS 111. I felt very disconnected, frustrated, and lost for the vast majority of the class.</td>

Definitely use Office Hours, they will basically give you the correct code if you ask the right questions and show a good understanding. The self evals are also huge grade boosters.</td>

Other Ctecs I read for this course especially with Jesse were harsh and inaccurate to my experience so I am writing what I wish I read then. Yes, there is a difficult course that is time consuming and you likely need to use resources outside lecture. However, don't let that stop you from taking this course or fearing it, especially because if you are considering 211 you probably are interested in pursuing more in CS and to do that you need to take this course. I actually enjoyed it and it was my favorite class this quarter. I had NEVER coded outside CS 111 before this and was able to do well, even without a partner on some assignments. I think Jesse is a great professor for this course. His enthusiasm for CS and quick live coding can be a bit overwhelming if you have no prior experience like I did but don't be afraid to ask questions and enjoy this wealth of info because once you understand it is fun and it will help down the line. Start projects early, go to office hours, and ask questions on campuswire. Make sure you take time in the beginning to learn the fundamentals because the projects build on each other. This quarter grades were 100% projects and Jesse was very flexible with providing help, extra time, or even allowing you to correct your code. I definitely felt like this course with Jesse is built so that you learn a lot that you can carry throughout your time with CS. It definitely isn't a course where lecture gives you everything you need if you don't have prior experiences but talking through problems at office hours and reading through documentation are helpful things to get used to and it also sparked my interest in the subject even more. If you read all this, my parting message is take the course when you can, knowing that you definitely can succeed if you put in the time and effort and take action when you need help.</td>

The overall structure of the course makes it feel very sink–or–swim, with a large portion of the burden of learning the material falling on you rather than on the professor or the TAs.  While this might in some ways be the norm for CS classes, the remote instruction combined with the teaching style of Professor Tov made this sink–or–swim approach feel even more prominent than normal, to the point where the course ended up feeling far less intuitive and enjoyable than it should have.

The homework projects were very difficult at times. Although it was very rewarding when I would figure something out, the amount of time it took was really disheartening, especially when I wouldn't be able to work it out in the end.
